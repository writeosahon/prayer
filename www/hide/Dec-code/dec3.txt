First Week of Advent Year B<br />
Today&rsquo;s Rosary: The Glorious Mystery<br />
<strong><span style="color:#ff0000">FIRST SUNDAY OF ADVENT</span></strong><br />
Advent is the season that begins the Liturgical Year. It originated in the early Church as a short period of intense preparation for the celebration of the nativity of the Lord on December 25. Advent slowly came to be structured into four Sundays with proper readings and prayers. This season is marked by devout and joyful expectation as we recall the first humble coming of the Lord at Bethlehem. At the same time, we are invited to direct our mind and heart towards Christ&rsquo;s final coming in glory at the end of time. This is well expressed both in the Scripture readings, in the prayers as well as in the two parts into which Advent is divided. During the first part of Advent, from the beginning until 16 December, the focus of the liturgy is on the second coming of the Lord, while during the second part, from 17 to 24 December, the emphasis is on the immediate preparation for Christmas.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Sunday:</span> <strong>The Vigilant Wait:</strong> The Advent readings invite us to be vigilant, to be ready to receive the Lord who is coming. The first reading says God is &ldquo;father&rdquo; and &ldquo;redeemer&rdquo;. Nobody is so enslaved by sin that he cannot be freed and &ldquo;redeemed&rdquo;. Today&rsquo;s gospel tells us that the &ldquo;redeemer&rdquo; comes, but we have to be vigilant. Those who sleep will remain slaves to sin, and will not be ransomed. The second reading is also on this theme: the Christians of Corinth are held up to us as examples of vigilance.</p>

Born in Spain in 1506, Francis was one of the first Jesuits. In 1537 he was ordained at Rome and there devoted himself to works of charity. In 1541 he felt the calling to be a missionary and went to preach the Gospel in the far East where he spent the rest of his life. For eleven years, in suffering and prayer, he brought the faith to parts of India, Sri Lanka and Japan. He died at the gates of China in 1552 at the age of 46.</p>

To you, I lift up my soul, O my God. In you, I have trusted; let me not be put to shame. Nor let my enemies exult over me; and let none who hope in you be put to shame.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000"><strong>The Gloria</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">When indicated this hymn is either sung or said</span><br />
Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to people of good will. We bless you, we adore you, we glorify you, we give you thanks for your great glory, Lord God, heavenly King, O God, almighty Father. Lord Jesus Christ, Only Begotten Son, Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us; you take away the sins of the world, receive our prayer; you are seated at the right hand of the Father, have mercy on us. For you alone are the Holy One, you alone are the Lord, you alone are the Most High, Jesus Christ, with the Holy Spirit, in the glory of God the Father. Amen.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Collect</span><br />
Grant your faithful, we pray, almighty God, the resolve to run forth to meet your Christ with righteous deeds at his coming, so that, gathered at his right hand, they may be worthy to possess the &nbsp;heavenly kingdom. Through our Lord. .</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING</strong><br />
<em>O that you would rend the heavens and come down.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Isaiah&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 63:16d-17;64:13b-8)</span><br />
You, O Lord, are our Father, our Redeemed from old is your name. O Lord, why do you make us err from your ways and harden our heart, so that we do not fear you? Return for the sake of your servants, the tribes of your heritage. O that you would tear the heavens and come down, that the mountains might quake at your presence! You came down, the mountains quaked at your presence. From of old no one has heard or perceived by the ear, no eye has seen a God besides you, who works for those who wait for him. You meet him that joyfully works righteousness, those that remember you in your ways. Behold, you were angry, and we sinned; in our sins we have been a long time, and shall we be saved? We have all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment. We all fade like a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away. There is no one that calls upon your name, that bestirs himself to take hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us, and have delivered us into the hand of our iniquities. Yet, O LORD, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you are our potter; we are all the work of your hand.</p>

<p>The word of the Lord.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">RESPONSORIAL PSALM Ps 80:2ac and 3b. 15-16a.18-19 (R. 4)</span><br />
<strong><span style="color:#ff0000">R. </span>O God, bring us back;<br />
Let your face shine on us, and we shall be shaved.</strong></p>

<p>O shepherd of Israel, hear us,<br />
enthroned on the cherubim, shine forth.<br />
Rouse up your might and come to save us. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p>God of hosts, turn again, we implore;<br />
look down from heaven and see.<br />
Visit this vine and protect it,<br />
The vine your right hand has planted. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p>May your hand be on the man at your right hand,<br />
the son of man you have confirmed as your own.<br />
And we shall never forsake you again;<br />
Give us life that we may call upon your name. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>SECOND READING </strong><br />
<em>We wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the first Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 1:3-9)</span><br />
Brethren: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. I give thanks to God always for you because of the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus, that in every way you were enriched in him with all speech and all knowledge&mdash;even as the testimony to Christ was confirmed among you&mdash;so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift, as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ; who will sustain you to the end, guiltless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>The word of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>GOSPEL</strong><br />
<em>Watch therefore-for you do not know when the master of the house will come.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark (Mark 13:33-37)</span><br />
At that time: Jesus said to his disciples: &ldquo;Take heed, watch and pray; for you do not know when the time will come. It is like a man going on a journey, when he leaves home and puts his servants in charge, each with his work, and commands the door keeper to be on the watch. Watch therefore -&nbsp;for you do not know when the master of the house will come, in the evening, or at midnight, or at cockcrow, or in the morning, lest he come suddenly and find you asleep. And what I say to you I say to all: Watch.</p>

<p><strong>The Gospel of the Lord.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000"><strong>The Creed (I Believe)</strong></span><br />
I believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible. I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God, born of the Father before all ages. God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father; through him all things were made. For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and became man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate, he suffered death and was buried, and rose again on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. &nbsp;He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead and his kingdom will have no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified, who has spoken through the prophets. I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church. I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen.</p>
