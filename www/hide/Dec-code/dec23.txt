<p><strong>Collect</strong><br />
Almighty ever-living God, as we see how the Nativity of your Son according to the flesh draws near, we pray that to us, your unworthy servants, mercy may flow from your Word, who chose to become flesh of the Virgin Mary and establish among us his dwelling, Jesus Christ our Lord. Who lives and reigns with you. .</p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING &nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<em>Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the day of the Lord comes.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of the Prophet Malachi &nbsp;(Malachi3:1-4;4:5-6)</span><br />
Thus says the Lord GOD: &ldquo;Behold, I send my messenger to prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple; the messenger of the covenant in whom you delight, behold, he is coming, says the Lord of hosts. &nbsp;But who can endure the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appears? &nbsp;&ldquo;For he is like a refiner&rsquo;s fire and like fullers&rsquo; soap; he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, till they present right offerings to the Lord. Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the Lord as in the days of old and as in former years. &ldquo;Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes. And he will turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the land with acurse.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The word of the Lord.</strong></p>

<p><strong>GOSPEL &nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<em>The birth of John the Baptist.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke (Luke 1:57-66)&nbsp;</span><br />
The time came for Elizabeth to be delivered, and she gave birth to a son. And her neighbours and kinsfolk heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her. And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they would have named him Zechariah after his father, but his mother said, &ldquo;Not so; he shall be called John.&rdquo; And they said to her, &ldquo;None of your kindred is called by this name.&rdquo; And they made signs to his father, inquiring what he would have him called. And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, &ldquo;His name is John.&rdquo; And they all marvelled. And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, blessing God. And fear came on all their neighbours. And all these things were talked about through all the hill country of Judea; and all who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, &ldquo;What then will this child be?&rdquo; For the hand of the Lord was with him.</p>

May this oblation, by which divine worship in its fullness has been inaugurated for us, be our perfect reconciliation with you, O Lord, that we may celebrate with minds made pure the Nativity of our Redeemed. Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.</p>

Grant your peace, O Lord, to those you have nourished with these heavenly gifts, that we may be ready, with lighted lamps, to meet your dearly beloved Son at his coming. Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.</p>
