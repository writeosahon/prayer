Today&rsquo;s Rosary: The Joyful Mystery</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Entrance Antiphon: &nbsp;Wis18:14-15</strong><br />
When a profound silence covered all things, and night was in the middle of its course, your all-powerful Word, O Lord, bounded from heaven&rsquo;s royal throne.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000"><strong>The Gloria</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">When indicated this hymn is either sung or said</span><br />
Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to people of good will. We bless you, we adore you, we glorify you, we give you thanks for your great glory, Lord God, heavenly King, O God, almighty Father. Lord Jesus Christ, Only Begotten Son, Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us; you take away the sins of the world, receive our prayer; you are seated at the right hand of the Father, have mercy on us. For you alone are the Holy One, you alone are the Lord, you alone are the Most High, Jesus Christ, with the Holy Spirit, in the glory of God the Father. Amen.</p>

<p><strong>Collect</strong><br />
Grant, we pray, almighty God, that the newness of the Nativity in the flesh of your Only Begotten Son may set us free, for ancient servitude holds us bound beneath the yoke of sin. Through our Lord. .</p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING &nbsp;</strong><br />
<em>&ldquo;He who does the will of God abides for &nbsp;ever. &rdquo;</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the first Letter of Saint John (1 John 2:12-17)</span><br />
I am writing to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven for his sake. I am writing to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the Evil One. I write to you, children, because you know the Father. I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the Evil One. Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life, is not of the Father but is of the world. And the world passes away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever.</p>

<p><strong>The word of the Lord.</strong></p>

<p><strong>GOSPEL&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;<br />
<em>&ldquo;She spoke of him to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.&rdquo;</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke (Luke 2:36-40)</span><br />
At that time: There was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe ofAsher; she was of a great age, having lived with her husband seven years from her virginity, and as a widow till she was eighty-four. She did not depart from the temple, worshipping with fasting and prayer night and day. And coming up at that very hour she gave thanks to God, and spoke of him to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem. And when they had performed everything according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth. And the child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom; and the favour of God was upon him.</p>
