Second Sunday of Advent Year B&nbsp;<br />
Today&rsquo;s Rosary: The Glorious Mystery</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Sunday:</span> <strong>Conversion and New World</strong>. In the first reading, the prophet invites the people of Israel, exiled in Babylon, to prepare to welcome the Lord who is coming to free them. Their slavery is about to end. God will save them, but on their part, they must welcome this liberation, cross the desert and begin a new life in a new land. The Gospel continues this same theme. Another prophet invites Israel to conversion so that the Messiah may manifest himself and a new world may begin. The second reading tells us that when we speak of the coming of the Lord we should not merely be looking for a date for the end of the world, but rather we must welcome the Lord who comes to create a new world.</p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br />
<em>&ldquo;Prepare the way of the Lord.&rdquo;</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Isaiah &nbsp;( Isaiah 40: 1-5.9-11)</span><br />
Comfort, comfort my people, says your God. &nbsp;Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and cry to her that her warfare is ended, that her iniquity is pardoned, that she has received from the Lord&rsquo;s hand double for all her sins. A voice cries: &ldquo;In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill be made low; the uneven ground shall become level, and the rough places a plain. And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.&rdquo; Get you up to a high mountain, O Zion, herald of good tidings; lift up your voice with strength, O Jerusalem, herald of good tidings, lift it up, fear not; say to the cities of Judah, &ldquo;Behold your God!&rdquo; Behold, the Lord God comes with might, and his arm rules for him; behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him. He will feed his flock like a shepherd, he will gather the lambs in his arms, he will carry them in his bosom, and gently lead those that are with young.<br />
The word of the Lord.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">RESPONSORIAL PSALM&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ps85:9aband10.11-12.13-14(R.8)</span><br />
<strong><span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span> Let us see, O Lord, your mercy and grant us your salvation.</strong></p>

<p>I will hear what the Lord God speaks;<br />
He speaks of peace for his people and his faithful,&nbsp;<br />
His salvation is near for those who fear him,<br />
And his glory will dwell in our land. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p>Merciful love and faithfulness have met;<br />
&nbsp;justice and peace have kissed.<br />
Faithfulness shall spring from the earth,&nbsp;<br />
and justice look down from heaven. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p>Also the LORD will bestow his bounty,&nbsp;<br />
and our earth shall yield its increase.&nbsp;<br />
Justice will march before him,<br />
And guide his steps on the way.<span style="color:#ff0000"> R.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>SECOND READING &nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<em>&ldquo;We wait for new heavens and a new earth.&rdquo;</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the second Letter of Saint Peter (2 Peter3:8-14)</span><br />
Do not ignore this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. &nbsp;The Lord is not slow about his promise as some count slowness, but is for bearing towards you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance. But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, and the elements will be dissolved with fire, and the earth and the works that are upon it will be burnt up. Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, what sort of persons ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness, waiting for and hastening the coming of &nbsp;the day of God, because of which the heavens will be kindled and dissolved, and the elements will melt with fire! But according to his promise we wait. For new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells. Therefore, beloved, since you wait for these, be zealous to be found by him without spot or blemish, and at peace.<br />
The word of the Lord.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">ALLELUIA&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Luke 3:4.6</span><br />
Alleluia. Prepare the way for the Lord, make his paths straight; all flesh shall see the salvation of God.<span style="color:#ff0000">Alleluia.</span></p>

<p><br />
<strong>GOSPEL &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<em>&ldquo;Make straight the paths of the Lord.&rdquo;</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark (Mark I: 1-8)</span><br />
The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. As it is written in Isaiah the prophet, &ldquo;Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way; the voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.&rdquo; John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. And there went out to him all the country of Judea, and all the people of Jerusalem; and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. Now John was clothed with camel&rsquo;s hair, and had a leather belt around his waist, and ate locusts and wild honey. And he preached, saying, &ldquo;After me comes he who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. I have baptized you with water; but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;<br />
The Gospel of the Lord.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000"><strong>The Creed (I Believe)</strong></span><br />
I believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible. I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God, born of the Father before all ages. God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father; through him all things were made. For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and became man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate, he suffered death and was buried, and rose again on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. &nbsp;He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead and his kingdom will have no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified, who has spoken through the prophets. I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church. I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen.</p>
