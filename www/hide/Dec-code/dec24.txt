Today&rsquo;s Rosary: The Glorious Mystery</p>

<p><strong>DECEMBER 24&nbsp;</strong><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Sunday:</span> <strong>Jesus, the Promised Messiah. </strong>There have been, and still are, many people who profess to be &ldquo;messiahs&rdquo; and &ldquo;saviours&rdquo; of humanity. The readings today tell us that there is only one true Messiah: Jesus, the son of Mary. In the first reading we have seen in the prophecy of Nathan that the descendants of David will inherit an eternal kingdom. In the gospel Jesus is presented as the Messiah. He is the king who will sit on the throne of his father David for ever. The second reading is a song of praise to God for his wonderful works.</p>

<p><strong>Entrance Antiphon&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;cf. Is45:8</strong><br />
Drop down dew from above, you heavens, and let the clouds rain down the Just One; let the earth be opened and bring forth a Saviour.</p>

<span style="color:#ff0000">When indicated this hymn is either sung or said</span><br />
Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to people of good will. We bless you, we adore you, we glorify you, we give you thanks for your great glory, Lord God, heavenly King, O God, almighty Father. Lord Jesus Christ, Only Begotten Son, Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us; you take away the sins of the world, receive our prayer; you are seated at the right hand of the Father, have mercy on us. For you alone are the Holy One, you alone are the Lord, you alone are the Most High, Jesus Christ, with the Holy Spirit, in the glory of God the Father. Amen.</p>

<p><strong>Collect</strong><br />
Pour forth, we beseech you, O Lord, your grace into our hearts, that we, to whom the Incarnation of Christ your Son was made known by the message of an Angel, may by his Passion and Cross be brought to the glory of his Resurrection. Who lives and reigns with you. ..</p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<em>The kingdom of David shall be made sure for ever before the Lord.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the second Book of Samuel &nbsp; (2 Samuel 7:1-5.8b-12.14a.16)</span><br />
When King David dwelt in his house, and the Lord had given him rest from all his enemies round about, the king said to Nathan the prophet, &ldquo;See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells in a tent.&rdquo; And Nathan said to the king, &ldquo;Go, do all that is in your heart; for the Lord is with you.&rdquo; But that same night the word of the Lord came to Nathan, &ldquo;Go and tell my servant David, &lsquo;Thus says the Lord: Would you build me a house to dwell in? I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, that you should be prince over my people Israel; and I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth. And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be disturbed no more; and violent men shall afflict them no more, as formerly, from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel; and I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover the Lord declares to you that the Lord will make you a house. When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come forth from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. I will be his father, and he shall be my son. &ldquo;&lsquo;And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure for ever before me; your throne shall be established for ever.&rdquo;&rsquo;<br />
<strong>The word of the Lord.</strong></p>

Through all ages my mouth will proclaim your fidelity.<br />
I have declared your mercy is established forever;&nbsp;<br />
your fidelity stands firm as the heavens. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<em>&ldquo;Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son.&rsquo;</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke (Luke1:26-38)</span><br />
The angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin&rsquo;s name was Mary. And he came to her and said, &ldquo;Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you!&rdquo; But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered in her mind what sort of greeting this might be. And the angel said to her, &ldquo;Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there will be no end.&rdquo; And Mary said to the angel, &ldquo;How will this be, since I know not man?&rdquo; And the angel said to her, &ldquo;The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God. And behold, your kinswoman Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. For with God nothing will be impossible.&rdquo; And Mary said, &ldquo;Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.&rdquo; And the angel departed from her.</p>

<p><strong>The Gospel of the Lord.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000"><strong>The Creed (I Believe)</strong></span><br />
I believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible. I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God, born of the Father before all ages. God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father; through him all things were made. For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven, <strong>and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate </strong>of the Virgin Mary, and became man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate, he suffered death and was buried, and rose again on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. &nbsp;He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead and his kingdom will have no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified, who has spoken through the prophets. I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church. I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen.</p>

<em>&ldquo;The Lord takes delight in you.&rdquo;</em><br />

For Zion&rsquo;s sake I will not keep silent, and for Jerusalem&rsquo;s sake I will not rest, until her vindication goes forth as brightness, and her salvation as a burning torch. The nations shall see your vindication, and all the kings your glory; and you shall be called by a new name which the mouth of the Lord will give. You shall be a crown of beauty in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of your God. You shall no more be termed Forsaken, and your land shall no more be termed Desolate; but you shall be called My delight is in her, and your land Married; for the Lord delights in you, and your land shall be married.

<strong>SECOND READING&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><br />
<em>Paul gives witness to Christ, the son of David.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles (Acts13:16-17.22-25)</span><br />
[When Paul came to Antioch of Pisidia, he stood up in the synagogue,) and motioning with his hand said: &ldquo;Men of Israel, and you that fear God, listen. The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it. Then he raised up David to be their king; of whom he testified and said, &lsquo;I have found in David, the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who will do all my will.&rsquo; Of this man&rsquo;s posterity God has brought to Israel a Saviour, Jesus, as he promised. Before his coming John had preached a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. And as John was finishing his course, he said, &lsquo;What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but after me one is coming, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p><strong>GOSPEL</strong><br />
<em>The genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">The beginning of the holy Gospel according to Matthew &nbsp;(Matthew1:1-25</span><br />
The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the &nbsp;son of David, &nbsp;the &nbsp;son &nbsp;of &nbsp;Abraham. &nbsp;Abraham &nbsp;was &nbsp;the &nbsp;father &nbsp;of &nbsp;Isaac, &nbsp;and Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers, and Judah the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, and Perez the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram, and Ram the father of Amminadab, and Amminadab the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon, and Salmon the father of Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of &nbsp;Jesse, &nbsp;and &nbsp;Jesse &nbsp;the &nbsp;father &nbsp;of &nbsp;David the king. And David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah, and Solomon the father &nbsp;of Rehoboam, &nbsp;and Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asa, and Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah, and Uzziah the father of Jotham, &nbsp;and Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah, and Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, and Manasseh the father &nbsp;of Amos, and Amos the father of Josiah, and Josiah the father &nbsp; &nbsp; of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon. And after the deportation to Babylon: Jechoniah was &nbsp;the father of Shealtiel, and &nbsp;Shealtiel the father &nbsp;of Zerubbabel, and Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, and Abiud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor, and Azor the father of Zadok, and Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud, and Eliud the father of Eleazar, and Eleazar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob, &nbsp;and Jacob the father &nbsp;of Joseph the husband &nbsp;of Mary, &nbsp;of whom Jesus was born, who &nbsp;is called Christ. So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations.<br />
* Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit; and her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to send her away quietly. But as he considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, &ldquo;Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit; she will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.&rdquo; All this took place to fulfil what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: &ldquo;Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and his name shall be called Emmanuel&rdquo; (which means, God with us). When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him; he took his wife, but knew her not until she had borne a son; and he called his nameJesus.</p>

<em>&ldquo;A son is given to us.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Isaiah (Isaiah 9:2-7)</span><br />
The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shined. You have multiplied the nation, you have increased its joy; they rejoice before you as with joy at the harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the spoil. For the yoke of his burden, and the staff for his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, you have broken as on the day of Midian. For every boot of the tramping warrior in battle tumult and every garment rolled in blood will be burned as fuel for the fire. For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government will be upon his shoulder, and his name will be called &ldquo;Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.&rdquo; Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, upon the throne of David, and over his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and for evermore.

And his wonders among all the peoples. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p>Let the heavens rejoice and earth be glad;&nbsp;<br />
let the sea and all within it thunder praise.&nbsp;<br />
Let the land and all it bears rejoice. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p>Then will all the trees of the wood shout for joy,&nbsp;<br />
at the presence of the Lord, for he comes,<br />
he comes to judge the earth.<br />
He will judge the world with justice;<br />
He will govern the peoples with his truth. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<em>&ldquo;The grace of God has appeared for all men.&rdquo;</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to Titus &nbsp;(Titus 2: l 1-14)</span><br />
Beloved: The grace of God has appeared for the salvation of all men, training us to renounce irreligion and worldly passions, and to live sober, upright, and godly lives in this world, awaiting our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all iniquity and to purify for himself a people of his own who are zealous for good deeds.</p>

<p><strong>GOSPEL</strong><br />
<em>&ldquo;To us is born this day a Saviour.&rdquo;</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke &nbsp;( Luke &nbsp;2 : 1-14)</span><br />
In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled. This was the first enrollment, when Quirinius was governor of Syria. And all went to be enrolled, each to his own city. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be enrolled with Mary his betrothed, who was with child. And while they were there, the time came for her to be delivered. And she gave birth to her first-born son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths, and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn. And in that region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with fear. And the angel said to them&ldquo;Be not afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of a great joy which will come to all the people; for to you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord. And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.&rdquo; And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying, &ldquo;Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among men with whom he is pleased!&rdquo;<br />
The Gospel of the Lord.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000"><strong>The Creed </strong></span><strong>(I Believe)</strong><span style="color:#ff0000"><strong>&nbsp;All kneel at the words and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate.</strong></span><br />
I believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible. I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God, born of the Father before all ages. God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father; through him all things were made. For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven,<span style="color:#ff0000"> </span><strong><span style="color:#ff0000">and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate</span> </strong>of the Virgin Mary, and became man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate, he suffered death and was buried, and rose again on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. &nbsp;He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead and his kingdom will have no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified, who has spoken through the prophets. I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church. I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen.</p>
