<p><strong>GOSPEL</strong><br />
<em>No sign will be given to this generation. Except the sign of Jonah.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke (Luke 11:29-32)</span><br />
At that time: When the crowds were increasing, Jesus began to say, &ldquo;This generation is an evil generation; it seeks a sign, but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah. For as Jonah became a sign to the men of Nineveh, so will the Son of man be to this generation. The queen of the South will arise at the judgement with the men of this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here. The men of Nineveh will arise at the judgement with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.</p>
