<strong><em>THE HOLY GUARDIAN ANGELS (MEMORIAL):</em> </strong>A few days ago we celebrated the feast of the archangels Gabriel, Michael and Raphael. Today we give thanks to God for the presence of the guardian angels in our life. From infancy to death, we are surrounded by&nbsp;the watchful care and intercession of the angels, who are always before God. (See memorial Reading below)</p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING</strong><br />
<em>I will save my people from the east country and from the west country.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of the Prophet Zechariah (Zechariah 8:1-8)</span><br />
The word of the Lord of hosts came to me, saying, &ldquo;Thus says the Lord of hosts: I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath. Thus says the Lord: I will return to Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem, and Jerusalem shall be called the faithful city, and the mountain of the Lord of hosts, the holy mountain. Thus says the Lord of hosts: Old men and old women shall again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each with staff in hand for very age. And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets. Thus says the Lord of hosts: If it is marvelous in the sight of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvelous in my sight, says the Lord of hosts? Thus says the Lord of hosts: Behold, I will save my people from the east country and from the west country; and I will bring them to dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be my people and I will be their God, in faithfulness and in righteousness.</p>

<em>He who Is least among you all is the one who is great.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke (Luke 9:46-50)</span><br />
At that time: An argument arose among the disciples as to which of them was the greatest. But when Jesus perceived the thought of their hearts, he took a child and put him by his side, and said to them, &ldquo;Whoever receives this child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me; for he who is least among you all is the one who is great.&rdquo; John answered, &ldquo;Master, we saw a man casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he does not follow with us.&rdquo; But Jesus said to him, Do not forbid him; for he that is not against you is for you.</p>

<em>My angel will go before you.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Exodus&nbsp;(Exodus 23:20-23)</span><br />
Thus says the Lord, &ldquo;Behold, I send an angel before you, to guard you on the way and to bring you to the place which I have prepared. Give heed to him and listen to his voice, do not rebel against him, for he will not pardon your transgression; for my name is in him, but if you listen attentively to his voice and do all that I say, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries. My angel will go before you, and bring you in to the amorites, and the hittites, and the perizzites, and the canaannites, the Hivites, and the jebusites, and I will blot them out.</p>

<em>in heaven their angels always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew (Matthew 18:1-5.10)</span><br />
At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, &ldquo;who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?&rdquo; and calling to him a child, he put him in the midst of them, and said, &ldquo;truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Whoever humbles himself like this child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me. See that you do not despise one of these little ones; for I tell you that in heaven their angels always behold the face of my father who is in heaven.</p>
