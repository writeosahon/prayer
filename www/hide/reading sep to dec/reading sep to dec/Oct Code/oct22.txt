<strong>The memorial of St. John Paul II, Pope, is not celebrated this year.</strong><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Sunday</span>: T<strong>he Christian and the State.</strong>&nbsp; A Christian has the same rights as anybody else and does not claim exemption or privilege. Like everybody, we must also pay taxes. The first reading throws. Light on the relationship between faith and politics. God guides history so that everything may lead to the happiness of his people. The second reading is connected to this theme: it shows how in a concrete way the Christians of Thessalonica lived out their religion.</p>

<em>I have grasped the hand of Cyrus to subdue nations before him.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Isaiah (Isaiah 45:1.4-6)</span><br />
Thus says the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have grasped, to subdue nations before him and uncover the loins of kings, to open doors before him that gates may not be closed: &ldquo;For the sake of my servant Jacob, and Israel my chosen, I call you by your name, I surname you, though you do not know me. I am the Lord, and there is no other, besides me there is no God; I clothe you, though you do not know me, that men may know, from the rising of the sun and from the west, that there is none besides me; I am the Lord, and there is no other.</p>

<p>The word of the Lord.</p>

<em>Remember your faith, love, and hope.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">The beginning of the first Letter of Saint Paul to the Thessalonians (1 Thessalonians 1:1-5b)</span><br />
Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace. We give thanks to God always for you all, constantly mentioning you in our prayers, remembering before&nbsp; our God and Father our work of faith and labour of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. For we know, brethren beloved by God, that he has chosen you; for our Gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction.</p>

<p><strong>GOSPEL</strong><br />
<em>Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar&rsquo;s and to God the things that are God&#39;s</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew (Matthew 22:15-21)</span><br />
At that time: The Pharisees went and took counsel how to entangle Jesus in his talk. And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, &ldquo;Teacher, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God truthfully, and care for no man; for you do not regard the position of men. Tell us, then, what you think. Is it Lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?&rdquo; But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, &ldquo;Why put me to the test, you hypocrites? Show me the money for the tax.&rdquo; And they brought him a coin. And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Whose likeness and inscription is this?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;Caesar&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Then he said to them, &ldquo;Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar&rsquo;s, and to God the things that are God&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The Gospel of the Lord.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000"><strong>The Creed (I Believe)</strong></span><br />
I believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible. I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God, born of the Father before all ages. God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father; through him all things were made. For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and became man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate, he suffered death and was buried, and rose again on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. &nbsp;He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead and his kingdom will have no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified, who has spoken through the prophets. I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church. I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen.</p>
