Lawrence Ruiz &amp; Companions, M (Opt Mem)&nbsp;</span>Born and brought up in Bohemia, this young man showed great love for the poor, devotion to Mary and was imbued with a spirit of penance. As king he did whatever was in his power to promote the Christian faith. His holy life-style and zeal provoked opposition within his own family and, in 935, he was betrayed and assassinated by his own brother. He was only twenty- seven years old.</p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING</strong><br />
<em>Build the house, that I may take pleasure in it.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">The beginning of the Book of the Prophet Haggai (Haggai 1:1 -8)</span><br />
In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came by Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, &ldquo;Thus says the Lord of hosts: This people say the time has not yet come to rebuild the house of the Lord.&rdquo; Then the word of the Lord came by Haggai the prophet, &ldquo;Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your panelled houses, while this house lies in ruins? Now therefore thus says the Lord of hosts: Consider how you have fared. You have sown much, and harvested little; you eat, but you never have enough; you drink, but you never have your fill; you clothe yourselves, but no one is warm; and he who earns wages earns wages to put them into a bag with holes. &ldquo;Thus says the Lord of hosts: Consider how you have fared. Go up to the hills and bring wood and build the house, that I may take pleasure in it and that I may appear in my glory, says the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>The word of the Lord.</strong></p>

<p><strong>GOSPEL</strong><br />
<em>John I beheaded,&rsquo; but who is this about whom I hear such things?</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke (Luke 9:7-9)</span><br />
At that time: Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by Jesus, and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead, by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen. Herod said, &ldquo;John I beheaded; but who is this about whom I hear such things?&rdquo; And he sought to see him.</p>
