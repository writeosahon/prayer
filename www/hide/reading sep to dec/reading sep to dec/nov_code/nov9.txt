The Lateran Basilica, built by the Emperor Constantine on the Lateran Hill around the year 320, is the cathedral of the Pope who is the Bishop of Rome. This Basilica, dedicated to the Saviour, to Saint John the Baptist and to Saint John the Evangelist, is considered the Mother of all the Churches. The feast of its dedication reminds us of our calling to live in deep communion with the successor of Peter, the rock on which Jesus built his Church, and the one who confirms us in our faith.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000"><strong>Theme of the Feast: </strong></span><strong>We Are the Temple of God.</strong> The readings help us understand that all baptized members of the Church are called to be the temple of God, and to bear fruits of charity and holiness for the good of all humankind.</p>

<em>I saw water running from the temple, and all those to whom the water came were saved&rdquo; &nbsp;(Ant. Vidi aquam).</em><br />
<strong>A reading from the Book of the Prophet Ezekiel</strong><br />
In those days: The angel brought me back to the door of the temple; and behold, water was issuing from below the threshold of the temple towards the east (for the temple faced east); and the water was flowing down from below the right side of the threshold of the temple, south of the altar. Then he brought me out by way of the north gate, and led me round on the outside to the outer gate, that faces towards the east; and the water was coming out on the right side. And he said to me, &ldquo;This water flows towards the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah; and when it enters the stagnant waters of the sea, the water will become fresh. And wherever the river goes, every living creature which swarms will live, and there will be very many fish; for this water goes there, that the waters of the sea may become fresh; so everything will live where the river goes. &ldquo;And on the banks, on both sides of the river, there will grow all kinds of trees for food. Their leaves will not wither nor their fruit fail, but they will bear fresh fruit every month, because the water for them flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food and their leaves for healing.</p>

<p><strong>SECOND READING </strong><br />
<em>You are God&rsquo;s temple.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the first Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians (I Corinthians 3:9c-11.16-17)</span><br />
Brethren: You are God&rsquo;s building. According to the commission of God given to me, like a skilled master builder I laid a foundation, and another man is building upon it. Let&nbsp; each man take&nbsp; care how&nbsp; he builds upon it. For no other foundation can any one lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. Do you not know that you are God&rsquo;s temple and that God&rsquo;s Spirit dwells in you? If any one destroys God&rsquo;s temple, God will destroy him. For God&rsquo;s temple is holy,&nbsp; and that&nbsp; temple you are.</p>

<p><strong>GOSPEL</strong><br />
<em>He spoke of the temple of his body.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to John (John 2:13-22)</span><br />
The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and pigeons, and the money-changers at their business. And making a whip of cords, he drove them all, with the sheep and oxen, out of the temple; and he poured out the coins of the money- changers and overturned their tables. And he told those who sold the pigeons, &ldquo;Take these things away; you shall not make my Father&rsquo;s house a house of trade.&rdquo; His disciples remembered that it was written, &ldquo;Zeal for your house will consume me.&rdquo; The Jews then said to him, &ldquo;What sign have you to show us for doing this?&rdquo; Jesus answered them, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&rdquo; The Jews then said, &ldquo;It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?&rdquo; But he spoke of the temple of his body. When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.</p>
