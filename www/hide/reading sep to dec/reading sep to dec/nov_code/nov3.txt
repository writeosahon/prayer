<p><strong>FIRST READING</strong><br />
<em>I could wish that I myself were accursed for the sake of my brethren.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Romans(Romans 9:1-5)</span><br />
Brethren: I am speaking the truth in Christ, I am not lying; my conscience bears me witness in the Holy Spirit, that I have&nbsp;&nbsp; great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh. They are Israelites, and to them belong the sonship, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises; to them belong the patriarchs, and of their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen.</p>

<p><strong>GOSPEL</strong><br />
<em>Which of you, having a son or an ox that has fallen into a well, will not immediately pull him out on a sabbath day?</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke (Luke 14:1-6)</span><br />
One Sabbath when Jesus went to dine at the house of a ruler who belonged to the Pharisees, they were watching him. And behold, there was a man before him who had dropsy. And Jesus spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, &ldquo;Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath, or not? But they were silent. Then he took him and healed him, and let him go. And he said to them, Which of you, having a son or an ox that has fallen into a well, will not immediately pull him out on a sabbath day? And they could not reply to this.</p>
