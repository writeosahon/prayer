<p><strong>FIRST READING &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><br />
<em>Hannah gives thanks for the birth of Samuel.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the first Book of Samuel (1 Samuel 1:24-2b)</span><br />
In those days: Hannah took Samuel up with her, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a skin of wine; and she brought him to the house of the Lord at Shiloh; and the child was young. Then they slew the bull, and they brought the child to Eli. And she said, &ldquo;Oh, my lord! As you live, my lord, I am the woman who was standing here in your presence, praying to the Lord. For this child I prayed; and the Lord has granted me my petition which I made to him. Therefore I have lent him to the Lord; as long as he lives, he is lent to the Lord.&rdquo; And they worshipped the Lord there.<br />
The word of the Lord.</p>

<p>RESPONSORIAL PSALM &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1Samuel 2: 1.4-5.6-7.8abcd (R. see 1a)<br />
R. My heart exults in the Lord, my Saviour.</p>

<p>My heart exults in the Lord;<br />
My strength is exalted in the Lord.&nbsp;<br />
My mouth derides my enemies,&nbsp;<br />
because I rejoice in your salvation. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p>The bows of the mighty are broken,&nbsp;<br />
but the feeble gird on strength.<br />
Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread,&nbsp;<br />
but those who were hungry have ceased to hunger.<br />
The barren has borne seven,<br />
But she who has many children is forlorn.<span style="color:#ff0000"> R.</span></p>

<p>The Lord kills and brings to life;<br />
He brings down to Sheol and raises up.&nbsp;<br />
The Lord makes poor and makes rich;&nbsp;<br />
he brings low, he also exalts.<span style="color:#ff0000"> R.</span></p>

<p>He raises up the poor from the dust;&nbsp;<br />
he lifts the needy from the dung heap,&nbsp;<br />
to make them sit with princes<br />
and inherit a seat of honour. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">ALLELUIA</span><br />
Alleluia. Alleluia. Come, O King of the nations and cornerstone of the Church! Come and save man, whom you formed from the clay of the earth. <span style="color:#ff0000">Alleluia.</span></p>

<strong>GOSPEL &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><br />
<em>&ldquo;He who is mighty has done great things for me.&rdquo;</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke (Luke 1l:46-56)</span><br />
At that time: Mary said,<br />
&ldquo;My soul magnifies the Lord,<br />
And my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour,<br />
For he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden.<br />
For behold; henceforth all generations will call me blessed;&nbsp;<br />
for he who is mighty has done great things for me,<br />
and holy is his name.<br />
And his mercy is on those who fear him<br />
From generation to generation.<br />
He has shown strength with his arm,<br />
He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts,<br />
He has put down the mighty from their thrones, and exalted those of low degree;<br />
He has filled the hungry with good things,<br />
And the rich he has sent empty away.<br />
He has helped his servant Israel,<br />
In remembrance of his mercy, as he spoke to our fathers,<br />
To Abraham and to his posterity for &nbsp;ever.&rdquo;<br />
And Mary remained with Elizabeth about three months, and returned to her home.</p>
