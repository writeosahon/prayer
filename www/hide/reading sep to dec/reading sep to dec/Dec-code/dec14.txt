Today&rsquo;s Rosary: The Luminous Mystery</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">SAINT JOHN&nbsp; OF THE CROSS,</span> Priest and Doctor of the Church Memorial: &nbsp;Born near Avila (Spain) in 1542, John entered the Carmelites when he was 21 years old. After his priestly ordination, he began to cooperate with Saint Teresa ofAvila in reforming the Carmelites. This work of renewal brought him many, trials and much suffering, but his deep faith gave him the energy to continue. He wrote masterfully about the spiritual life and mystical union with God. Renowned for his wisdom and sanctity, he died in 1591.</p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING &nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;<br />
<em>I am your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Isaiah (Isaiah41:13-20)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br />
I, the Lord your God, hold your right hand; it is I who say to you, &ldquo;Fear not, I will help you.&rdquo; Fear not, you worm Jacob, you men of Israel! I will help you, says the Lord; your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel. Behold, I will make of you a threshing sledge, new, sharp, and having teeth; you shall thresh the mountains and crush them, and you shall make the hills like chaff; you shall winnow them and the wind shall carry them away, and the tempest shall scatter them. And you shall rejoice in the Lord; in the Holy One of Israel you shall glory. When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue is parched with thirst, I the Lord will answer them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them. I will open rivers on the bare heights, and fountains in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water. I will put in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia, the myrtle, and the olive; I will set in the desert the cypress, the plane and the pine together; that men may see and know, may consider and understand together, that the hand of the Lord has done this, the Holy One of Israel has created it.</p>

<p><strong>The word of the Lord.</strong></p>

<strong>GOSPEL &nbsp;</strong><span style="color:#ff0000"> &nbsp;</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<em>No one greater than John the Baptist has risen.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew (Matthew 11:11-15)</span><br />
At that time: Jesus said to the crowds, &ldquo;Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and men of violence take it by force. For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John; and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</p>

<p><strong>The Gospel of the Lord.</strong></p>
