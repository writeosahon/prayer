<p><strong>FIRSTREADING&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;<br />
<em>&ldquo;I will raise up for David&quot; a righteous Branch.&rdquo;</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 23:5-5)</span><br />
&ldquo;Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice &nbsp;and righteousness &nbsp;in the &nbsp;land. In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely. And this is the name. by which he will be called: &lsquo;The Lord is our righteousness.&rsquo; &ldquo;Therefore, behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when men shall no longer say, &lsquo;As the Lord lives who brought up the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt,&rsquo; but &lsquo;As the Lord lives who brought up and led the descendants of the house of Israel out of the north country and out of all the countries where he had driven them.&rsquo; Then they shall dwell in their own land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The word of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>GOSPEL&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;<br />
<em>Jesus was born of Mary, the betrothed of Joseph, a son of David.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew (Matthew1:18-24)</span><br />
The birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit; and her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to send her away quietly. But as he considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, &ldquo;Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit; she will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.&rdquo; All this took place to fulfil what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: &ldquo;Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and his name shall be called Emmanuel&rdquo; (which means, God with us). When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him.</p>
