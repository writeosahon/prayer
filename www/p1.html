<p style="margin-left:.25in"><strong>The creed</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:0.25in; text-align:justify">I believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible. I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God, born of the father before all ages. God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father; through him all things were made. For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and became man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate, he suffered death and was buried, and rose again on the third day in accordance with the scriptures. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the hand of the father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead and his kingdom will have no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the lord the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified, who has spoken through the prophets. I believe in one, holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church. I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen. &nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">May the lord accept the sacrifice at your hands for the praise and glory of his name, for our good and the good of all his holy Church.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><span style="color:#ff0000"><em>The priests adds:</em></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><em>The people</em></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">It is right and just.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><span style="color:#ff0000"><em>The priest continues the preface and at the end the people sing or say aloud:</em></span></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Heaven and earth are full of your glory.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hosanna in the highest.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000"><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The priest then says:</em></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">You are Holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness. Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray, by sending down your Spirit upon them like the dewfall, so that they may become for us the Body and Blood of our Lord, Jesus Christ.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">At the time he was betrayed he was entered willingly into his passion,</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><span style="color:#ff0000"><em>He takes the bread and, holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues:</em></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">He took bread and, giving thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><strong>TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND EAT OF IT, FOR THIS IS MY BODY, WHICH WILL BE GIVEN UP FOR YOU.</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><span style="color:#ff0000"><em>After this, he continues:</em></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice and, once more giving thanks, he gave it to his disciples, saying:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><strong>TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND DRINK FROM IT, FOR THIS IS THE CHALICE OF MY BLOOD, THE BLOOD OF THE NEW AND ETERNAL COVENANT, WHICH WILL BE POURED OUT FOR YOU AND FOR MANY FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS. </strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><strong>DO THIS IN MEMORY OF ME. </strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><span style="color:#ff0000"><em>Then he says:</em></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">The mystery of faith.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><span style="color:#ff0000"><em>And the people continues</em></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">We Proclaim Your Death, O Lord, And Profess Your Resurrection Until You Come Again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">Or</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">When We Eat This Bread And Drink This Cup, We Proclaim Your Death, O Lord Until You Come Again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">Or</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">Save Us Savior Of The World, For By Your Cross And Resurrection You Have Set Us Free.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><span style="color:#ff0000">The priest continues, says:</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">Therefore, as we offer the memorial of his Death and Resurrection, we offer you, Lord, the Bread of life and the chalice of salvation, giving thanks that you have held us worthy to be in your presence and minister to you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">Humbly we pray that, partaking of the Body and Blood of Christ, we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">Remember, Lord, your Church, spread throughout the world, and bring her to the fullness of charity, together with our N. our Pope and N. our Bishop and all the clergy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">Remember also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection, and all who have died in your mercy: welcome them into the light of your face. Have mercy on us all, we pray, that with the blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, with the blessed Apostles, and all the saints who have pleased you throughout the ages, we may merit to be coheirs to eternal life, and may praise and glorify you. Through your Son, Jesus Christ.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><span style="color:#ff0000"><em>He takes the chalice and the paten with the host and raising both, he says:</em></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">Through him, and with him, and in him, O God, almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honour is yours, for ever and ever.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><em>The people acclaim:</em></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><strong>Amen. </strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><span style="color:#ff0000"><em>The priest with his hands joined, says:</em></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">At the saviour&rsquo;s command and formed by divine teaching, we dare to say:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><span style="color:#ff0000"><em>Together with the people, continues</em></span></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our Father, who art in heaven,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hallow be thy name;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thy kingdom come,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Give us this day our daily bread,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And forgive us our trespasses,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As we forgive those who trespass against us;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And lead us not into temptation,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But deliver us from evil.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><span style="color:#ff0000">The priest alone continues, saying:</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil, graciously grant peace in our days, that , by the help of your mercy, we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress, as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our Saviour, Jesus Christ.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><span style="color:#ff0000"><em>The people concludes the prayer:</em></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">For the kingdom, the power and the glory are yours now and for ever.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><span style="color:#ff0000"><em>Then the priest says aloud:</em></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your Apostles: peace I leave you, my peace I give you; look not on our sins, but on the faith of your church, and graciously grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">Who lives and reign for ever and ever.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><span style="color:#ff0000"><em>The people reply:</em></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><strong>Amen. </strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><span style="color:#ff0000"><em>The priest, turned towards the people, and adds: </em></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><span style="color:#ff0000"><em>The priest adds:</em></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">Let us offer each other the sign of peace.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">All offer one another a sign in expression of peace.&nbsp; The priest continue the prayer quietly, meanwhile the following is sung or said</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><strong>Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><strong>Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><strong>Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><span style="color:#ff0000"><em>Then the priest, with hands joined, prays quietly. After which takes the host and, holding it slightly raised above the chalice, while facing the people, says aloud:</em></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><strong>Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in"><span style="color:#ff0000"><em>The priest, facing the altar, prays quietly, and while the priest is receiving communion, the communion chant begins and when the distribution of communion is over, the priest purifies the paten and the chalice then returns back to his chair, then a sacred silence is observed for a while. </em></span></p>
