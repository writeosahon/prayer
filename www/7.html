<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Let&#39;sPray</span><br />
Most Merciful Jesus, whose Heart is Love Itself, receive into the abode of Your Most Compassionate<br />
Heart the souls of those who particularly extol and venerate the greatness of Your mercy.<br />
These souls are mighty with the very power of God Himself. In the midst of all afflictions and adversities they go forward,<br />
confident of Your mercy; and united to You, O Jesus, they carry all mankind on their shoulders.<br />
These souls will not be judged severely, but Your mercy will embrace them as they depart from this life.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Concluding Prayers</span><br />
<em>Eternal Father, turn Your merciful gaze upon the souls who glorify and venerate Your greatest attribute, </em><br />
<em>that of Your fathomless mercy, and who are enclosed in the Most Compassionate Heart of Jesus. </em><br />
<em>These souls are a living Gospel; their hands are full of deeds of mercy, and their hearts, overflowing with joy, </em><br />
<em>sing a canticle of mercy to You, O Most High! I beg You O God: Show them Your mercy according to the hope and trust they </em><br />
<em>have placed in You. Let there be accomplished in them the promise of Jesus, who said to them that during their life, </em><br />
<em>but especially at the hour of death, the souls who will venerate this fathomless mercy of His, He, </em><br />
<em>Himself, will defend as His glory. Amen.</em><br />
