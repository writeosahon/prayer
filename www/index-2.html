Protect, o most provident guardian of the holy family, the chosen children of Jesus Christ. Ward off from us, o most loving father, all taint of error and corruption. Graciously assist us from heaven o most powerful protector in our struggle with the powers of darkness and as you did once rescue the child Jesus from imminent peril to his life, so now defend the Holy church of God from the snares of her enemies and from all adversity. Shield each one of us with your unceasing patronage, so that imitating your example and support by your aid, we may be enabled to live a good life, die a holy death and secure everlasting happiness in heaven.
