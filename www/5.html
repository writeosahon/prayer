<p><em><span style="color:#ff0000">Let&#39;s&nbsp;pray</span></em><br />
Most Merciful Jesus, Goodness Itself, You do not refuse light to those who seek it of You.<br />
Receive into the abode of Your Most Compassionate Heart the souls of those who have separated themselves from Your Church.<br />
Draw them by Your light into the unity of the Church, and do not let them escape from the abode of Your Most Compassionate Heart;<br />
but bring it about that they, too, come to glorify the generosity of Your mercy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Concluding Prayers</span><br />
<em>Eternal Father, turn Your merciful gaze upon the souls of those who have separated themselves from Your Son&#39;s Church, </em><br />
<em>who have squandered Your blessings and misused Your graces by obstinately persisting in their errors. </em><br />
<em>Do not look upon their errors, but upon the love of Your own Son and upon His bitter Passion, </em><br />
<em>which He underwent for their sake, since they, too, are enclosed in His Most Compassionate Heart. </em><br />
<em>Bring it about that they also may glorify Your great mercy for endless ages. Amen.&nbsp;</em><br />
