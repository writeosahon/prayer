<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>&quot;The Stations of the Cross is a Lenten devotion that offers witness to Jesus, Passion and Death. At each station we use our senses and our imagination to reflect prayerfully upon Jesus suffering, Death, and Resurrection and to simply experience the visual images to reflect on Christ&rsquo;s love for us.</h4>
<p><span style="color:#b22222"><span style="font-family:Georgia,serif">INTRODUCTION</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222"><em>The priest reminds the congregation of some specific intentions</em></span></p>

<p>My dear brothers and sisters in Christ, Christ is still dying. He continues to offer himself to his father for the redemption of the world through the men who today suffer and die around us. The way of the cross is also the way to life; this a real Christian should never forget.</p>
<p><span style="color:#b22222"><span style="font-family:Georgia,serif">CHRIST SPEAKS</span></span></p>

<p>These fourteen steps that you are about to walk you do not take alone.&nbsp; I am with you. We are truly one. And therefore my way of the cross two thousand years ago and your own &lsquo;&rsquo;way&rsquo;&rsquo; now are also one. Yet there is a difference. My life was incomplete until I crowned it with my death. Your fourteen steps will not be complete until you crown them with your life.&nbsp;</p></td>

<p style="text-align: center;">READING FROM ISAIAH, (Chapter 53)</p>

<p>By oppression and judgment he was taken away: and as for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my people. And they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death, although he had done no violent action and there was no deceit in his mouth. Yet, it was the will of the Lord to bruise him; he has put him to grief; when he makes himself an offering for sin, he shall see his offspring, he shall prolong his days; the will of the Lord shall proper in his hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family:Georgia,serif"><span style="color:#b22222">CHRIST SPEAKS</span></span></p>

<p>I have fallen down again, completely drained of strength; my body cannot move. And yet my will is mine so is yours. My other self this one thing is certain, your body may be broken but no force on earth and none in hell can take away your will. You will is yours.</p>
<p><span style="color:#b22222"><span style="font-family:Georgia,serif">MAN RESPONDS</span></span></p>

<p>My Lord, after a moment&rsquo;s rest, you took off again and staggered on. I can do the same because my will is mine. When all my strength is gone and guilt and self-reproach press me to earth and seem to hold me fast, when I am pressed down by the consideration that I am of a fallen race, protect me from the sin of Judas. Save me from despair. Lord, never let me feel that any sin is greater than your love. No matter what my past has been, I can begin anew.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">CONCLUSION</h2>

<p>You remember what I told you at the beginning? When you joined me on the way of my cross. I said: My life was incomplete until I crowded it with my death.&rsquo;&rsquo;Your fourteen steps will not be complete until you crown that them with your life. Accept each moment that comes to you with faith and trust all that happens to you has my mark on it. Seek me not in far-away places. I am very close to you. At home, at work, in the street, these are alters where you offer love. And I am there with you. I want you to live your life, so now, take up your cross and fellow me.</p>
<p>V: Parce Domine<br />
R: Parce populo tuo, ne in aeternum irascaris nobis</p>

<p>V: Spare oh! Lord<br />
R: Spare your people, do not be angry with us forever</p>

<p>V: Pie Jesu, Domine!<br />
R: Dona eis requiem Sempiterna</p>

<p>V: Loving Jesus, O Lord!<br />
R: Give the eternal rest forever</p>
