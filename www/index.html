<p><strong>A reading from the Book of Isaiah&nbsp; <span style="color:#ff0000">(Isaiah 11:1-10)</span></strong></p>

<p><em><strong>With righteousness he will judge the poor.</strong></em></p>

<p>On that day: There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots. And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord. And his delight shall be in the fear of the Lord. He shall not judge by what his eyes see, or decide by what his ears hear; but with righteousness he shall judge the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the earth; and he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall slay the wicked. Righteousness shall be the belt of his waist, and faithfulness the belt of his loins. The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid, and the calf and the lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them. The cow and the bear shall feed; their young shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. The sucking child shall play over the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the adder&rsquo;s den. They shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea. In that day the root of &nbsp;Jesse shall stand as an ensign to the peoples; him shall the nations seek, and his dwellings shall be glorious.</p>

<p><strong><em>He is our peace, bring hostility to an end in the flesh</em></strong></p>

<p>Brethren: Now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near in the blood of Christ. For he is our peace; who has made is both one, and has broken down the dividing will of hostility, by abolishing in his flesh the law of commandments and ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two, so making peace, and might reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross; thereby bringing the hostility to an end. And he came and preached peace to you who were far off and peace to these who were near; for through him we both have accept in one Spirit to the Father. You re no longer stranger and so journers, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God; built upon the foundation of the apost1es and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, in whom the whole structures is Joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you also are built into it for a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:5.2pt">When the Wise Men had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, Rise, take the child and&nbsp; his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there till I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.&rdquo; And he rose and took the child and his mother by night, and departed to Egypt, and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfil what the Lord had&nbsp; spoken by the prophet, &ldquo;Out of Egypt have&nbsp; I called my son. But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, &ldquo;Rise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child&rsquo;s life are dead. And he rose and took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel. But when he heard that Archelaus reigned over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and being warned in a dream he withdrew to the district of Galilee. And he went and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled, &ldquo;He shall be called a Nazarene.&rdquo;</p>

Feast Day:</strong></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Sunday: </span>A Faith That Works Miracles. The theme linking today&rsquo;s three readings is faith. In the first, God, through the prophet Habakkuk, urges the people of Israel not to give up because of difficulties or situations that seem to shake their faith in God. In the gospel Jesus is telling us that faith is a very powerful force, capable of unhoped-for results. Faith is not something that gives us a right to reward. It is a gift that helps us to understand life and brings us happiness. We must thank God for it. At times we forget the gifts we have received and it is necessary to &lsquo;fan the flame&rsquo; and once again become aware of our privileged situation and the responsibility that entails. This is what Paul is recommending to us in the second reading.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong><span style="color:#ff0000">FIRST READING </span></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>A reading from the Book of the Prophet Habakkuk <span style="color:#ff0000">(</span></em><span style="color:#ff0000">Habakkuk 1:2-3; 2:2-4)</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>The righteous shall live by his faith.</em></strong></p>

<p><em>O Lord, how long shall I cry for help, and you will not hear? Or cry to you Violence! and you will not save? Why do you make me see wrongs and look upon trouble? Destruction and violence are before me; strife and contention arise. And the Lord answered me: Write the vision; make it plain upon tablets, so he may run who reads it. For still the vision awaits its time; it hastens to the end it will not lie. If it seem slow, wait for it; it will surely come, it will not delay. Behold, he whose soul is not upright in him shall fail, but the righteous shall live by his faith.</em></p>

<p><strong>A reading from the second Letter of Saint Paul to Timothy Beloved:<span style="color:#ff0000"> (2 Timothy 1:6-5. 13- 14)</span></strong></p>

<p><em><strong>Do not be ashamed of testifying to our Lord.</strong></em></p>

<p>I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands; for God did not give us a spirit of timidity but a spirit of power and love and self-control. Do not be ashamed then of testifying to our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but take your share of suffering for the Gospel in the power of God. Follow the pattern of the sound words which you have heard from me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus; guard the truth that has been entrusted to you by the Holy Spirit who dwells within us.</p>

<p><strong><em>&quot;If you had faith!&quot; </em></strong></p>

<p>At that time: The apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith! And the Lord said, If you had faith as a grain of mustard&nbsp; seed, you could say to this sycamine tree, Be rooted up, and be planted in the sea, and it would obey you. Will any one of you, who has a servant ploughing or keeping sheep, say to him when he has come in from the field, Come at once and sit down at table? Will he not rather say to him, Prepare supper for me, and put on your apron and serve me, till I eat and drink; and afterwards you shall eat and drink? Does he thank the servant because he did what was commanded? So you also, when you have done all that is commanded you, say, We are unworthy servants; we have only done what was our duty.</p>

<p><strong><em>I did </em><em>not </em><em>receive </em><em>the </em><em>Gospel from man, nor was I taught it, but it came through a revelation of Christ.</em></strong></p>

<p>Brethern: I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and turning to a different gospel not that there is another gospel, but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ. But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to that which we preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again, If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to that which you received, let him be accursed. Am I now seeking the favour of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ. For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not mans gospel. For I did not receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came through a revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><em><strong>Who is my neighbour?</strong></em></p>

<p>At that time: Behold, a lawyer stood up to put Jesus to the test, saying, Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?&rdquo; He said to him, What is written in the law? What do you read there? And he answered, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbour as yourself. And he said to him, You have answered right; do this, and you will live. But he, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbour? Jesus replied, A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. Now by chance a priest was going down that road; and when he saw him he passed by on the other side. So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was; and when he saw him, he had compassion, and went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; then he set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. And the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back. Which of these three, do you think, proved neighbour to the man who fell among the robbers? He said, &ldquo;The one who showed mercy on him. And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Go and do likewise.</p>

<p><strong>A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Galatians&nbsp; <span style="color:#ff0000">(Galatians 1:13-24)</span></strong></p>

<p><em><strong>He revealed his Son to me, in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles.</strong></em></p>

<p>Brethren: You have heard of my former life in Judaism, how I persecuted the Church of God violently and tried to destroy it; and I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers. But when he who had set me apart before I was born, and had called me through his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son to me, in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not confer with flesh and blood, nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned to Damascus. Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and remained with him fifteen days. But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lords brother. (In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie!) Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. And I was still not known by sight to the churches of Christ in Judea; they only heard it said, He who once persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy. And they glorified God because of me.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#ff0000">FIRST READING </span></strong></p>

<p><strong>A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Galatians (Galatians 2 : 1-2.7-14)</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>They perceived the grace that was given to me</em>.</strong></p>

<p>Brethren. After fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along with me. I went up by revelation; and I laid before them (but privately before those who were of repute) the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, lest some- how I should be running or had run in vain. But on the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just&nbsp; as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel&nbsp; to the circumcised (for he who worked through Peter for the mission to the circumcised worked through me also for the Gentiles), and when they perceived the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of. fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised; only they would have&nbsp; us remember the poor, which very thing I was eager to do. But when Cephas came to Antioch I opposed him to his face, because stood condemned. For before certain men came from&nbsp; &nbsp;James he ate with the Gentiles; but when they came he drew back and separated himself, fearing the circumcision party. And with him the rest of the Jews acted insincerely, so that even Barnabas was carried away by their insincerity. But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all, If you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?</p>

<p><em><strong>Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law, or by hearing with faith?</strong></em></p>

<p>O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified? Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law, or by hearing with faith? Are you so foolish? Having begun with the Spirit, are you now ending with the flesh? Did you experience so many things in vain? &mdash; if it really is in vain. Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith?</p>

I tell you, though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him whatever he needs. And I tell you, Ask, and it will be given you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For every one who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.

<p><em><strong>Those who are men of faith are blessed with Abraham who had faith.</strong></em></p>

<p>Brethren: You see that it is men of faith who are the sons of Abraham. And Scripture, foreseeing that&nbsp; God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, In you shall all the nations be blessed. So then, those who are men of faith are blessed with Abraham who had faith. For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, Cursed be every one who does not abide by all things written in the book of the law, and do them. Now it is evident that no man is justified before God by the law; for &ldquo;He who through faith is righteous shall live; but the law does not rest on faith, for He who does them shall live by them. Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us &mdash; for it is written, Cursed be every one who hangs on a tree&rdquo; &mdash; that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</p>

<p><strong>If it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.</strong></p>

<p>At that time: [When Jesus had cast out a demon,] some of the people said, He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of demons; while others, to test him, sought from him a sign from heaven. But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and house falls upon house. And if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul. And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges. But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, his goods are in peace; but when one stronger than he assails him and overcomes him, he takes away his armour in which he trusted, and divides his spoil. He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters. When the unclean spirit has gone out of a man, he passes through waterless places seeking rest; and finding none he says, &lsquo;I will return to my house from which I came.&rsquo; And when he comes he finds it swept and put in order. Then he goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em><strong>You are all sons of God, through faith.</strong></em></p>

<p>Brethren: The Scripture consigned all things to sin, that what was promised to faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. Now before&nbsp; faith came, we were confined under the law, kept under restraint until faith should be revealed. So that the law was our custodian until Christ came, that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a custodian; for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. For as many of you as were baptised into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you are Christ&rsquo;s, then you are Abraham offspring, heirs according to promise.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Sunday</span>: The One Who Heals Lepers Is Amongst Us. Why are we proud when we do something good? Why do we feel superior to others? We forget that we are lepers who have been healed by the word of Jesus. The gospel tells us that the first to understand this truth were those Jews considered heretics. The first reading shows us Naaman, a leper and foreigner. He is healed both in body and in spirit by his encounter with the man sent by God. The second reading gives us the example of Paul, who was aware that he had been a leper. Christ saved him and enabled him to bear everything for the sake of the gospel.</p>

<p>In those days: Naaman the Syrian went down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of Elisha the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was cleansed [from his leprosy]. Then he returned to the man of God , he and all his company, and he came and stood before him; and he said, Behold, I know that there is no God in all the earth but in Israel; so accept; now a present from your servant. But he said, As the Lord lives, whom I serve, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it, but he refused. Then Naaman said, If not, I beg you, let there be given to your servant two mules burden of earth; for henceforth your servant will not offer burnt offering or sacrifice to any god but the Lord.</p>

<p>Beloved: Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, descended from David, as preached in my Gospel, the Gospel for which I am suffering and wearing chains like a criminal. But the word of God is not chained. Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation which in Christ Jesus goes with eternal glory.

If we have died with him, we shall also live with him;&nbsp;<br />
if we&nbsp; endure, we&nbsp; shall also reign with &nbsp;him;&nbsp;<br />

<p>On the way to Jerusalem Jesus was passing along between Samaria and Galilee.

When he saw them he said to them, &ldquo;Go and show yourselves to the priests. And as they went they were cleansed. Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice; and he fell on his face at Jesus feet, giving him thanks. Now he was a Samaritan. Then said Jesus, Were not ten cleansed? Where are the nine? Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner? And he said to him, Rise and go your way; your faith has made you well.</p>

<p><em><strong>We are not children of the slave but of the free woman.</strong></em></p>

<p>Brethren: It is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave and one by a free woman. But the&nbsp; son&nbsp; of the slave was born according to the flesh, the son of the free woman through promise Now this is an allegory: these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar. But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother. For it is written, Rejoice, O barren one who does not bear; break forth and shout, you who are not with labour pains; for the desolate has more children than she who has a husband. So, brethren, we are not children of the slave but of the free woman. For freedom Christ has set us free; stand fast therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.</p>

<p><em><strong>No sign will be given to this generation except the sign of Jonah. </strong></em></p>

<p>At that time: When the crowds were increasing, Jesus began to say, This generation is an evil generation; it seeks a sign, but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah. For as Jonah became a sign to the men of Nineveh, so will the Son of man be to this generation. The queen of the South will arise at the judgement with the men of this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here. The men of Nineveh will arise at the judgement with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.</p>

<p><em><strong>Circumcision is of no avail, but faith working through love.</strong></em></p>

<p>Brethren: For freedom Christ has set us free; stand fast therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery. Now I, Paul, say to you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no advantage to you. I testify again to every man who receives circumcision that he is bound to keep the whole law. You are severed&nbsp; from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace. For through the Spirit, by faith, we wait for the hope of righteousness. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any avail, but faith working through love.</p>

<p><strong>A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Galatians&nbsp; <span style="color:#ff0000">(Galatians 5:18-25)</span></strong></p>

<p><em><strong>Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passion.</strong></em></p>

<p>Brethren: If you are led by the Spirit you are not under the law. Now the works of the flesh are plain: immorality, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, anger, selfishness, dissension, party spirit, envy, drunkenness, carousing, and the like. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such there is no law. And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. If we live by the Spirit, &lsquo;let us also walk by the Spirit.</p>

<p><em><strong>He chose us in him before the foundation of the world.</strong></em></p>

<p>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, to the saints who are also faithful in Christ Jesus: Grace and peace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. He destined us in love to be his sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved. In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace which he lavished upon us. For he has made known to us&nbsp; in all wisdom and insight the mystery of his will, according to his purpose which he set forth in Christ as a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth:</p>

So you are witnesses and consent to the deeds of your fathers; for they killed them, and you build their tombs. Therefore also the Wisdom of God said, I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and persecute, that the blood of all the prophets, shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation, from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, it shall be required of this generation. Woe to you lawyers! for you have taken away the key of knowledge; you did not enter yourselves, and you hindered those who were entering. &rdquo;As he went away from there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to press him hard, and to provoke him to speak of many things, lying in wait for him, to catch him in something he might say.</p>

<p>At that time: When so many thousands of the multitude had gathered together that they trod upon one another, Jesus began to say to his disciples first, Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. Nothing is covered up that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. Whatever you have said in the dark shall be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in private rooms shall be proclaimed upon the housetops. &ldquo;I tell you, my friends, do not fear those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. But I will warn you whom to fear: fear him who, after he has killed, has power to cast into hell; yes, I tell you, fear him! Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? And not one of them is forgotten before God. Why, even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not; you are of more value than many sparrows.</p>

Feast Day:</strong></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Sunday</span>: It Is Difficult at Times to Hold on to One&rsquo;s Faith! The first reading and the gospel show us two examples of people who pray, one without tiring and the other with determination. Both achieve their goals, salvation for the people of Israel (Moses) and &nbsp;justice (the widow). Only if we pray like them will we always be ready to accept the kingdom of God. The Lord generally delays, because his time is not ours, his ways are not our ways, his thoughts are not our thoughts. If we pray we will not lose hope and when the Lord comes to do justice, we will be found vigilant. In the second reading we hear Paul&rsquo;s counsel to Timothy, study the Holy Scriptures!&rdquo; Constant contact with the word of God is the best prayer.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#ff0000">FIRST READING </span></strong></p>

<p><strong>A reading from the Book of Exodus <span style="color:#ff0000">(Exodus 17:5-13)</span></strong></p>

<p><em><strong>Whenever. Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed.</strong></em></p>

<p>In those days: Amalek came and fought with Israel at Rephidim. And Moses said to Joshua, &ldquo;Choose for us men, and go out, fight with Amalek; tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.&rdquo; &nbsp;So Joshua did as Moses told him, and fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. Whenever Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed; and whenever he lowered his hand, Amalek prevailed. But Moses&rsquo; hands grew weary; &nbsp;so they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat upon it, and Aaron and Hur held up his hands, one on one side, and the other on the other side; so his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. And Joshua mowed down Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.</p>

<p>At that time: Jesus told his disciples a parable, to the effect that they ought always to pray and not lose heart. He said, &ldquo;In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor regarded man; and there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, Vindicate me against my adversary. For a while he refused; but afterwards he said to himself, Though I neither fear God nor regard man, yet because this widow bothers me, I will vindicate her, or she will wear me out by her continual coming. And the Lord said, Hear what the unrighteous judge says. And will not God vindicate his elect, who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long over them? I tell you, he will vindicate them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man comes, will he find faith on earth?</p>

<p><strong>A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Ephesians <span style="color:#ff0000">(Ephesians 2: 1-10)</span></strong></p>

<p><em><strong>He made us alive together with Christ and made us sit with him in the heavenly places.</strong></em></p>

<p>Brethren: You he made alive, when you were; dead through&nbsp; the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience. Among these we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, following the desires of body and mind, and so we were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. But God, who is rich in mercy, out of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised us up with him, and made us sit ,with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness towards us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith; and this is not your own doing, it is the gift of God &mdash; not because of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.</p>

<p>At that time: One of the multitude said to Jesus, Teacher, bid my brother divide the inheritance with me. But he said to him, Man, who made me a judge or divider over you? And he said to them, Take heed, and beware of all covetousness; for a mans life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions. And he told them a parable, saying, The land of a rich man brought forth plentifully; and he thought to himself, &lsquo;What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops? And he said, I will do this: I will pull down my barns, and build larger ones; and there I will store all my grain and my goods. And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, be merry. But God said to him, &lsquo;Fool! This night your soul is required of you; and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?&#39; So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.</p>

<p>&quot;Luke alone is with me.&quot;</p>

<p>Beloved: Demas, in love with this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. Luke alone is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you; for he is very useful in serving me. Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus. When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, also the books, and above all the parchments. Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm; the Lord will pay him back for his deeds. Beware of him yourself, for he strongly opposed our message. At my first defence no one took my part; all deserted me. May it not be charged against them! But the Lord stood by me and gave me strength to proclaim the word fully, that all the Gentiles might hear it.</p>

<p>At that time: The Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them on ahead of him, two by two, into every town&nbsp; and place where he himself was about to come. And he said to them, The harvest is plentiful, but the labourers are few; pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out labourers into his harvest. Go your way; behold, I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves. Carry no purse, no bag, &nbsp;no sandals; and salute no one on the road. Whatever house you enter, first say, &lsquo;Peace be to this house! And if a son of peace is there, your peace shall rest upon him; but if not, it shall return to you. And remain in the same house, eating and drinking what they provide, for the labourer deserves his wages; do not go from house to house. Whenever you enter a town and they receive you, eat what is set before you; heal the sick in it and say to them, &lsquo;The kingdom of God has come near to you.</p>

<p><strong>A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Ephesians <span style="color:#ff0000">(Ephesians 3:2- 12)</span></strong></p>

<p><em>The mystery of Christ has now been revealed, how the Gentiles are fellow heirs of the promise.</em></p>

<p>Brethren: I assume that you have heard of the stewardship of God grace that was given to me for you, how the mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I have written briefly. When you read this you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ; which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit; that is, how the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of &nbsp;the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel. Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God grace which was given me by the working of his power. To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to make all men see what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things; that through the Church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the principalities and powers in the heavenly places. This was according to the eternal purpose which he has realised in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have boldness and confidence of &nbsp;access through our faith in him.</p>

<p>At that time: Jesus said to his disciples, &ldquo;know this, that if the householder had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would have been awake and would not have left his house to be broken into. You also must be ready; for the Son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect, Peter said, Lord, are you telling this parable for us or for all?&rdquo; And the Lord said, Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom is master will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the proper time? Blessed is that servant whom his master when he comes will find so doing. Truly I tell you, he will set him over all his possessions. But if that servant says to himslf, my master is delayed in coming, and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink and get drunk, the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know, and will punish him, and put him with the unfaithful. And that servant who knew his master&rsquo;s will, but did not make ready or act according to his will, shall receive a severe beating. But he who did not know, and did what deserved a beating, shall receive a light beating. Every one to whom much is given, of him will much be required; and of him to whom men commit much they will demand the more.</p>

<p><em>Christ is the head from whom the whole body is joined and knit together.</em></p>

<p>Brethren: Grace was given to each of us according to the measure of Christ&rsquo;s gift. Therefore it is said, &ldquo;When he ascended on high he led a host of captives, and he gave gifts to men. (In saying, &ldquo;He ascended,&rdquo; what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower parts of the earth? He who descended is he who also ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.) And his gifts were that some should be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers,&nbsp; for the equipment of the saints, for the work of ministry,&nbsp; for building up the body&nbsp; of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ; so that we may no longer be children, tossed back and forth and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the cunning of men, by their craftiness in deceitful wiles. Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by every joint&nbsp; with which&nbsp; it is supplied, when each part is working properly, makes bodily growth and upbuilds itself in love.</p>

I tell you, No; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish. Or those eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them, do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others who dwelt in Jerusalem? I tell you, No; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish. And he told this parable: A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came seeking fruit on it and found none. And he said to the vinedresser, Behold, these three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and I find none. Cut it down; why should it use up the ground?&rsquo; And he answered him, Let it alone, sir, this year also, till I dig about it and put on manure. And if it bears fruit next year, well and good; but if not, you can cut it down.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Sunday:</span> Before God We All Stand Empty-handed. The gospel today will not be easily understood unless we keep in mind what the first reading teaches us about God&rsquo;s justice. God is just, says Ben Sira, not because he grants each person what the person deserves, but because he saves the poor and listens to the cries of the defenceless. The gospel tells us that this is God&rsquo;s attitude. He is moved by the publican who can present only his misery and his sins. The second reading too can be seen in this light. Paul is saying that one day he will receive from God the &ldquo;crown&rdquo; that the just judge will give to all those who have given their lives for the Gospel. It will be a gift, not a reward due to him.</p>

<p><em>The prayer of the humble pierces the clouds.</em></p>

<p>The Lord is the judge, and with him is no partiality. He will not show partiality in the case of a poor man; and he will listen to the prayer of one who is wronged. He will not &nbsp;ignore the supplication of the fatherless, nor the widow when she pours out her story. He whose service is pleasing to the Lord will be accepted, and his prayer will reach to the clouds. The prayer of the humble pierces the clouds, and he will not be consoled until it reaches the Lord; he will not desist until the Most High visits him, and the just judge executes judgement. And the Lord will not delay, neither will he be patient with them.</p>

From now on there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me on that Day, and not only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing.

The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.

<p><strong>A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Ephesians<span style="color:#ff0000"> (Ephesians 4: 3,2 - 5:8)</span></strong></p>

<p><em>Walk in love, as Christ loved us.</em></p>

<p>Brethren: Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you. Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children. And walk in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God. But immorality and all impurity or covetousness must not even be named among you, as is fitting among saints. Let there be no filthiness, nor silly talk, nor levity, which are not fitting; but instead let there be thanksgiving. Be sure of this, that no immoral or impure man, or one who is covetous (that is, an idolater), has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for it is because of these things that the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. Therefore do not associate with them, for once you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord; walk as children of &nbsp;light.</p>

<p>At that time: Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath. And there was a woman who had had a spirit of infirmity for eighteen years; she was bent over and could not fully straighten herself. And when Jesus saw her, he called her and said to her, Woman, you are freed from your infirmity. And he laid his hands upon her, and immediately she was made straight, and she praised God. But the ruler of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had healed on the sabbath, said to the people, There are six days on which work ought to be done; come on those days and be healed, and not on the sabbath&nbsp; day. Then the Lord answered him, You hypocrites ! Does not each of you on the sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger, and lead it away to water it? And ought not this woman, a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound for eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day? As he said this, all his adversaries were put to shame; and all the people rejoiced at all the glorious things that were done by him</p>

<p><em>This is a great mystery, and I mean in reference to Christ and the Church.</em></p>

<p>Brethren: Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ. Wives, be subject to your husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the Church, his body, and himself its Saviour. As the Church is subject to Christ, so let wives also be subject in everything to their husbands. Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the Church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, that he might present the Church to himself in splendour, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish. Even so husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. For no man ever hates his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, as Christ does the Church, because we are members of his body. For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. This is a great mystery, and I mean in reference to Christ and the Church; however, let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband.</p>

When once the householder has risen up and shut the door, you will begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, open to us. He will answer you, I do not know where you come from. Then you will begin to say, We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets. But he will say, I tell you, I do not know where you come from; depart from me, all you workers of iniquity! There you will weep and gnash your teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God and you yourselves thrust out. And men will come from east and west, and from north and south, and sit at table in the kingdom of God. And behold, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.</p>

Stand therefore, having fastened the belt of truth around your waist, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and having shod your feet with the equipment of the gospel of peace; above all taking the shield of faith, with which you can quench all the flaming darts of the Evil One. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. Pray at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication. To that end keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints, and also for me, that utterance may be given me in opening my mouth boldly to proclaim the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains; that I may declare it boldly, as I ought to speak.</p>

For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. If it is to be life in the flesh, that means fruitful labour for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell. I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account. Convinced of this, I know that I shall remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith, so that in me you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus, because of my coming to you again.</p>

Now he told a parable to those who were invited, when he marked how they chose the places of honour, saying to them, When you are invited by any one to a marriage feast, do not sit down in a place of honour, lest a more eminent man than you be invited by him; and he who invited you both will come and say to you, Give place to this man, and then you will begin with shame to take the lowest place. But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when your host comes he may say to you, Friend, go up higher then you will be honoured in the presence of all who sit at table with you. For every one who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.</p>

Feast Day:</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Sunday: Those Who Are Themselves Loved Can Love Others.</span> All that God has created is good. The first reading says that God loves all his creatures, otherwise he would not have made them. How then can we hate anything? The gospel brings before us a man who, according to the thinking of the time, was evil and despised. How Jesus saw Zacchaeus teaches us how we should see people. The gospel gives us the image of a God as a Father who sent his Son to seek out what was lost. What went on in Thessalonica can happen in our communities. False preachers may try to spread another gospel, a gospel of their own invention, a gospel encouraging fear of God. The words of Paul in the second reading put us on our guard against them.</p>

<p><strong>A reading from the Book of Wisdom <span style="color:#ff0000">(Wisdom 11 :22&mdash;12:2)</span></strong></p>

<p>You are merciful to all, for you love all things that exist.</p>

<p>LORD, the whole world before you is like a speak that tips the scales, and like a drop of morning dew that falls upon the ground. But you are merciful to all, for you can do all things, and you overlook men&rsquo;s sins, that they may repent. For you love all things that exist, and you loathe none of the things which you have made, for you would not have made anything if you had hated it. How would anything have endured if you had not willed it? Or how would anything not called forth by you have been preserved? You spare all things, for they are yours, O Lord who love the living. For your immortal spirit is in all things. Therefore you correct little by little those who trespass, and remind and warn them of the things wherein they sin, that they may be freed from wickedness and put their trust in you, O Lord.</p>

<p><em>The name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in him.</em></p>

<p>Brethren: We always pray for you, that our God may make you worthy of his call, and may fulfill every good resolve and work of faith by his power, so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ. Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our assembling to meet him, we beg you, brethren, not to be quickly shaken in mind or excited, either by spirit or by word, or by letter purporting to be from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come.</p>

<p><em>The Son of man came to seek and to save the lost.</em></p>

<p>At that time: Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through. And there was a man named Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector, and rich. And he sought to see who Jesus was, but could not, on account of the crowd, because he was small of stature. So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was to pass that way. And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, Zacchaeus, make haste and come down; for I must stay at your house today. So he made haste and came down, and received him joyfully. And when they saw it they all murmured, He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner. And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have defrauded any one of anything, I restore it fourfold. And Jesus said to him, Today salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham. For the Son of man came to seek and to save the lost.</p>

<p><em>Complete my joy by being of the same mind.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brethren: If there is any encouragement in Christ, any incentive of love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. Do nothing from selfishness or conceit, but in humility count others better than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.</p>

But God shows his love for us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us. Since, therefore, we are now justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God. For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life. Not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.<br />

And when he has found it, he lay sit on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbours, saying to them, &lsquo;Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost. &rsquo;Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance. &ldquo;Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it?

And he called him and said to him, &lsquo;What is this that I hear about you? Turn in the account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward.&rsquo; &ldquo;And the steward said to himself, &lsquo;What shall I do, since my master is taking the stewardship away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg. I have decided what to do, so that people may receive me in to their houses when I am put out of the stewardship.&rsquo; So, summoning his master&rsquo;s debtors one by one, he said to the first, &lsquo;How much do you owe my master?&rsquo; &ldquo;He said, &lsquo;A hundred measures of oil.&rsquo; &ldquo;And he said to him, &lsquo;Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.&rsquo; &ldquo;Then he said to another, &lsquo;And how much do you owe?&rsquo; &ldquo;He said,&lsquo;A hundred measures of wheat.&rsquo; &ldquo;He said to him, &lsquo;Take your bill, and write eighty. &rsquo; &ldquo;The master commended the dishonest steward for his prudence; for the sons of this world are wiser in their own generation than the sows of light.&rdquo;<br />

<p><strong>A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Philippians</strong>&nbsp; <span style="color:#b22222"> (Philippians 4: 10-19)</span><br />
<em>&ldquo;I can do all things in him who strengthens me.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Brethren: I rejoice in the Lord greatly that now at length you have revived your concern for me; you were indeed concerned for me, but you had no opportunity. Not that I complain of want; for I have learnt, in whatever state I am, to be content. I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound; in any and all circumstances I have learnt the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and want. I can do all things in him who strengthens me. Yet it was kind of you to share my trouble. And you Philippians yourselves know that in the beginning of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church entered into partnership with me in giving and receiving except you only; for even in Thessalonica you sent me help once and again. Not that I seek the gift; but I seek the fruit which increases to your credit. I have received full payment, and more; I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God. And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.<br />

<em>&ldquo;If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will entrust to you the true riches?&quot; </em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">At that time: Jesus said to his disciples, &ldquo;Make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous mammon, so that when it fails they may receive you into the eternal habitations. &ldquo;He who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much; and he who is dishonest in a very little is dishonest also in much. If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will entrust to you the true riches? And if you have not been faithful in that which is another&rsquo;s, who will give you that which is your own? No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.&rdquo; The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all this, and they scoffed at him. But he said to them, &ldquo;You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts; for what is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.&rdquo;<br />

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Sunday: All Have Life because of Him</span>. When we speak of resurrection, we must be careful. Let us not take it to mean what the Pharisees and the Sadducees at the time of Jesus took it to mean, merely an improvement on this life. The story of the woman with seven husbands as well as other misunderstandings between believers and unbelievers stem from this wrong notion. The first reading reveals the first solemn statement in the Bible of life beyond death. This truth, so central to our faith, will be fully revealed by Jesus. Our faith in the resurrection influences our whole way of looking at human existence. Our faith must be nourished by prayer as Paul recommends in the second reading.</p>

<em>&ldquo;The king of the universe will raise us up to an everlasting renewal of life.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">In those days: It happened that seven brothers and their mother were arrested and were being compelled by the king, under torture with whips and cords, to partake of unlawfuls wine&rsquo;s flesh. One of them, acting as their spokesman, said, &ldquo;What do you intend toask and learn from us? For we are ready to die rather than transgress the laws of our fathers.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when [the second] was at his last breath, he said, &ldquo;You accursed wretch, you dismiss us from this present life,&nbsp; but the King of the universe will raise us up to an everlasting renewal of life, because we have died for his laws.&rdquo;&nbsp; After him, the third was the victim of their sport. When it was demanded, he quickly put out his tongue and courageously stretched forth his hands, and said nobly, &ldquo;I got these from Heaven, and because of his laws I disdain them, and from him I hope to get them back again.&rdquo; As a result the king himself and those with him were astonished at the young man&rsquo;s spirit, for he regarded his sufferings as nothing. When he too had died, they maltreated and tortured the fourth in the same way. And when he was near death, he said, &ldquo;One cannot but choose to die at the hands of men and to cherish the hope that God gives of being raised again by him. But for you there will be no resurrection to life!&rdquo;<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">Brethren: May our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts and establish them in every good work and word.

<em>&ldquo;He is not God of the dead, but of the living.&rdquo;</em><br />
<br />
At that time: There came to Jesus some Sadducees, those who say that there is no resurrection, and they asked him a question, saying, &ldquo;Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man&rsquo;s brother dies, having a wife but no children, the man must take the wife and raise up children for his brother. Now there were seven brothers; the first took a wife, and died without children; and the second and the third took her, and likewise all seven left no children and died. Afterword the woman also died. In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will the woman be? For the seven, had her as wife&rdquo; And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage, but those who are accounted worthy to attain to that age and to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage, for they cannot die any more, because they are equal to angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection. But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the passage about the bush, where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob,. Now he is not God of the dead, but of the living: for all live to him.&rdquo;<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The beginning of the Letter of Saint Paul to Titus</strong> <span style="color:#b22222">(Titus 1 :1-9)</span><br />
<em>&ldquo;Appoint elders as I directed you,&rdquo;</em><br />
<br />
Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to further the faith of God&rsquo;s elect and their knowledge of the truth which accords with godliness, in hope of eternal life which God, who never lies, promised ages ago and at the proper time manifested in his word through the preaching with which I have been entrusted by command of God our Saviour; to Titus, my true child in a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour. This is why I left you in Crete, that you might amend what was defective, and appoint elders in every town as I directed you, if any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, and his children are believers and not open to the charge of debauchery and not being insubordinate. For a bishop, as God&rsquo;s steward, must be blameless; he must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent or greedy for gain, but hospitable, a lover of goodness, master of himself, upright, holy, and self-controlled; he must hold firm to the sure word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it.<br />

Show yourself in all respects a model of good deeds, and in your teaching show integrity, gravity, and sound speech that cannot be censured, so that an opponent may be put to shame, having no thing evil to say of us.

And he told those who sold the pigeons,&ldquo;Take these things away; you shall not make my Father&rsquo;s house a house of trade.&rdquo;His disciples remembered that it was written, &ldquo;Zeal for your house will consume me.&rdquo;The Jews then said to him, &ldquo;What sign have you to show us for doing this?&rdquo; Jesus answered them, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. &rdquo;The Jews then said, &ldquo;It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days? &rdquo;But he spoke of the temple of his body. When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.<br />

<strong>A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to Philemon</strong> <span style="color:#b22222">(Philemon 7-20)</span><br />
<em>Receive him, no longer as a slave, but as a beloved brother.</em><br />
<br />
Beloved: I have derived much joy and comfort from your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you. Accordingly, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required, yet for love&rsquo;s sake I prefer to appeal to you I, Paul, an ambassador and now a prisoner also for Christ Jesus, I appeal to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I have become in my imprisonment. (Formerly he was useless to you, but new he is indeed useful to you and to me.) I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart. I would have been glad to keep him with me, in order that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel; but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be by compulsion but of your own free will. Perhaps this is why he was parted from you for a while, that you might have him back forever, nolonger as a slave but more than a slave, as a beloved brother, especially to me but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. So if you consider me your partner, receive him as you would receive me. If he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account. I, Paul, write this with my own hand, I will repay it to say nothing of your owing me even your own self. Yes, brother, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.<br />

<br />
At that time: Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was coming, Jesus answered them, &ldquo;The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed; nor will they say, &lsquo;Behold, here it is! &rsquo; or &lsquo;There!&rsquo; for behold, the kingdom of God is in your midst.&rdquo; And he said to the disciples, &ldquo;The days are coming when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and you will not see it. And they will say to you, &lsquo;Behold, there! &rsquo; or&lsquo; Behold, here! &rsquo;Do not go, do not follow them. For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other, so will the Son of man be in his day.

<em>&ldquo;He who abides in the doctrine has both the Father and the Son. &rdquo;</em><br />
<br />
[Elect lady,] I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children following the truth, just as we have been commanded by the Father. And now I beg you, lady, not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning, that we love one another. And this is love, that we follow his commandments; this is the commandment, as you have heard from the beginning, that you follow love. For many deceivers have gone out into the world, men who will not acknowledge the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh; such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist. Look to yourselves, that you may not lose what you have worked for, but may win a full reward. Any one who goes ahead and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not have God; he who abides in the doctrine has both the Father and the Son.<br />

Likewise as it was in the days of Lot&mdash;they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built, but on the day when Lot went out from Sodom, fire and brimstone rained from heaven and destroyed them all&mdash;so will it be on the day when the Son of man is revealed. On that day, let him who is on the house top, with his goods in the house, not come down to take them away; and likewise let him who is in the field not turn back. Remember Lot&rsquo;s wife. Whoever seeks to gain his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will preserve it. I tell you, in that night there will be two men in one bed; one will be taken and the other left.

<em>God will vindicate his elect, who cry to him.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">At that time: Jesus told his disciples a parable, to the effect that they ought always to pray and not lose heart. He said, In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor regarded man; and there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, Vindicate me against my adversary. For a while he refused; but afterward he said to himself, Though I neither fear God nor regard man, yet because this widow bothers me, I will vindicate her, or she will wear me out by her continual coming. And the Lord said,Hear what the unrighteous judge says. And will not God vindicate his elect, who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long over them? I tell you, he will vindicate them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man comes, will he find faith on earth?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Sunday: Courage, Raise Your Head!</span> The imagery used in the readings today is not difficult to follow, but must be properly understood. The first reading and the gospel are not about the end of the world. Though the readings speak of &ldquo;the end of the world&rdquo; the world they mean is&ldquo; the world of sin, of suffering, of injustice, of hatred......&rdquo;This is the world that will be wiped out, demolished, says God and its place will be taken by a completely new reality where only good will exist. Christians know that this new world began at the death and resurrection of Christ. Its full manifestation is still to come. It will be completely fulfilled only at the end of the history. The suffering and persecution that disciples must put up with are to be seen as&quot; birth pangs,&rdquo; sufferings that bring forth life not death. These condreading warns us of the danger facing the Christians of Thessalonica: people who offer miraculous ways out of all our problems. The &ldquo;new world&rdquo; will be built little by little, with alot of patience, tolerance, and alot of suffering and it must begin inside each one of us.</p>

Brethren:You know how you ought to imitate us; we were not idle when we were with you, we did not eat any one&rsquo;s bread without paying, but with toil and labour we worked night and day, that we might not burden any of you. It was not because we have not that right, but to give you in our conduct an example to imitate. For even when we were with you, we gave you this command: If any one will not work, let him not eat.

And when you hear of wars and tumults, do not be terrified; for this must first take place, but the end will not be at once.&rdquo; Then he said to them, &ldquo;Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and pestilences; and there will be terrors and great signs from heaven. But before all this they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors for my name&rsquo;s sake.

<em>&ldquo;If any one opens thedoor, I will come in to him and eat with him. &rdquo;</em><br />
<br />
I, John, heard the Lord saying to me:&ldquo;To the angel of the Church in Sardis write:&lsquo;The words of him who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. I know your works; you have the name of being alive, and you are dead. Awake, and strengthen what remains and is on the point of death, for I have not found your works perfect in the sight of thy God. Remember then what you received and heard; keep that, and repent. If you will not awake, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come upon you. Yet you have still a few names in Sardis, people who have not soiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy. He who conquers shall be clothed like them in white garments, and I will not blot his name out of the book of life; I will confess his name before my Father and before his angels. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. And to the angel of the Church in Laodicea write: The words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of God&rsquo;s creation. I know your works: you are neither cold nor hot. Would that you were cold or hot! So, because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew you out of my mouth. For you say, I am rich, I have prospered, and I need nothing; not knowing that you are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked. Therefore I counsel you to buy from me gold refined by fire, that you may be rich, and white garments to clothe you and to keep the shame of your nakedness from being seen, and salve to anoint your eyes, that you may see.

<em>&ldquo;The Son of man came to seek and to save the lost.&rdquo;</em><br />
<br />
At that time: Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through. And there was a man named Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector, and rich. And he sought to see who Jesus was, but could not, on account of the crowd, because he was small of stature. So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was to pass that way. And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, &ldquo;Zacchaeus, make haste and come down; for I must stay at your house today.&rdquo; So he made haste and came down, and received him joyfully. And when they saw it they all murmured, &ldquo;He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.&rdquo; And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, &ldquo;Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it four fold. &rdquo;And Jesus said to him,&ldquo;Today salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham. For the Son of man came to seek and to save the lost.&rdquo;<br />

<em>&ldquo;Holy is the Lord God Almighty,whowas and is and is to come.&rdquo;</em><br />
<br />
I, John, looked, and behold, in heaven anopen door! And thefirst voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said, &ldquo;Come up here; and I will show you what must take place after this.&rdquo; At once I was in the Spirit, and behold, a throne stood in heaven, with one seated on the throne! And he who sat there appeared like jasper and camelian, And round the throne was a rainbow that looked like an emerald. Round the throne were twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones were twenty-four elders, clothed in white garments, with golden crowns upon their heads. From the throne issue flashes of lightning, and voices and peals of thunder, and before the throne bum seven touches of fire, which are the seven spirits of God; and before the throne there is as it were a sea of glass, &#39;like crystal. And round the throne,on each side&#39; of the throne, are four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind: the first liking creature like a lion, the second living creature like an ox, the third living creature with the face of a man, and the fourth living creature like a flying eagle. And the four living creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of eyes all round and within, and day and night they never cease to sing, &ldquo;Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come!&rdquo; And whenever the living creatures give glory and honour and thanks to him who is seated on the throne, who lives fed ever and ever, the twenty&mdash;four elders fall down before him who is seated on the throne and worship him who lives for ever and ever; they cast their crowns before the throne,singing, &ldquo;Worthy are you, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honour and power, for you created all things, and by your will they existed and we recreated.&rdquo;<br />

<em>&ldquo;Why did you not put my money into the bank? &rdquo;</em><br />
<br />
At that time: Jesus proceeded to tell a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately. He said therefore, &ldquo;A nobleman went into a far country to receive kingly power and then return. Calling ten of his servants, he gave them ten pounds, and said to them, &lsquo;Trade with these till I come.&rsquo; &ldquo;But his citizens hated him and sent an embassy after him, saying, &lsquo;We do not want this man to reign over us. &rsquo; &ldquo;When he returned, having received the kingly power, he commanded these servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by trading. The first came before him, saying, &lsquo;Lord, your pound has made ten pounds more. &rsquo; &ldquo;And he said to him, &lsquo;Well done,good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very little, you shall have authority over ten cities. &rsquo; &ldquo;And the second came, saying,&lsquo;Lord, your pound has made five pounds.&rsquo;&ldquo;And he said to him,&lsquo;And you are to be over five cities.&rsquo; &ldquo;Then another came, saying, &lsquo;Lord, here is your pound, which I kept laid away in a napkin; for I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man; you take up what you did not lay down, and reap what you did not sow.&rsquo; &ldquo;He said to him, &lsquo;Iwill condemn you out of your own mouth, you wicked servant! You knew that I was a severe man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow? Why then did you not put my money into the bank, and at my coming I should have collected it with interest?&rsquo; &ldquo;And he said to those who stood by, &lsquo;Take the pound from him, and give it to him who has the ten pounds. &rsquo; &ldquo;(And they said to him, &lsquo;Lord, he has ten pounds! &rsquo;)&ldquo;&lsquo;I tell you, that to every one who has will more be given; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away. But as for these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them before me. &rdquo;&rsquo; And when Jesus had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">I, John, saw in the righth and of him who was seated on the throne a scroll written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals; and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with aloud voice, &ldquo;Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?&rdquo; And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it, and I wept much that no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it. Then one of the elders said to me, &ldquo;Weep not; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals.&rdquo; And between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders, I saw a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, with seven horns and with seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth; and he went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne. And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp, and with golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints; and they sang a new song, saying,&ldquo;Worthy are you to take the scroll and to open its seals, for you were slainand by your blood you ransomed men for God from every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and have made them a kingdom and priests to our God, and they shall reign on earth.&rdquo;<br />

<em>&ldquo;These two prophets had been atorment to those who dwell on the earth.&rdquo;</em><br />
<br />
I, John, was told: &ldquo;[Behold, my two witnesses;]&rdquo; these are the two olive trees and the two lamp stands which stand before the Lord of the earth. And if anyone would harm them, fire pours from their mouth and consumes their foes; if anyone would harm them, thus he is doomed to be killed. They have power to shut the sky,that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying, and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to afflict the earth with every plague, as often as they desire. And when they have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends from the bottom less pit will make war upon them and conquer them and kill them, and their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city which is allegorically called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord was crucified. For three days and a half men from the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations gaze at their dead bodies and refuse to let them be placed in a tomb, and those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them and make merry and exchange presents, because these two prophets had been atorment to those who dwell on the earth. But after the three and a half days a breath of life from God entered them, and they stood upon their feet, and great fear fell on those who saw them. Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, &ldquo;Come up here! &rdquo;And in the sight of their foes they went up to heaven in a cloud.<br />

<em>&ldquo;&#39;He is the lord of the Dead but of the living.&rdquo;</em><br />
At that time: There came to Jesus some Sadducees, those who say that there is no resurrection, and they asked him a question, saying, &ldquo;Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man&rsquo;s brother dies, having a wife but no. children, the man must take the wife and raise up children for his brother. Now there were seven brothers, the first took a wife, and died without children; and the second and the third took her, and likewise all seven left no children and died. After ward the woman also died. &lsquo;In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will the woman be? For the seven had her as wife.&rdquo; And Jesus said to them,&ldquo;The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage; but those who are accounted worthy to attain to that age and to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage, for they cannot die anymore, because they are equal to angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection. But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the passage about the bush, Where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. Now he is not God of the dead, but of the living; For all to live to him.&rdquo; And some of the scribes answered, &ldquo;Teacher,&nbsp; you have spoken well. &rdquo;For they no longer dared to ask him any question.&rsquo;<br />

CHRIST THE KING RI</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Sunday: A King Who Condemns Nobody.</span> The first reading tells us how David, after defeating all his enemies, was anointed king over all Israel. His kingdom, great and powerful, became the symbol of the kingdom of peace and justice that God would one day establish on earth. Israel waited many centuries for the coming of the one who would begin this kingdom. The gospel gives us God&rsquo;s answer to expectations. Jesus was not proclaimed king as he sat on a throne, but when he was nailed to a cross. His victory is the victory of love, not of arrogance or violence, as the second reading tells us. We end Year C and the liturgical cycle of three years with the image of Jesus forgiving everybody. Let us keep in mind that God&rsquo;s thoughts are not our thoughts, his ways are not ours. The heavens are as high above earth as his thoughts are above our thoughts <em>(Is55:8-9)</em>.</p>

In those days: All the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron, and said, &ldquo;Behold, we are your bone and flesh. In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you that led out and brought in Israel; and the Lord said to you, &lsquo;You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over Israel. &rdquo;&rsquo; So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron; and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the Lord, and they anointed David king over Israel.<br />

<em>&ldquo;He has transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son. &rdquo;</em><br />

Brethren: We give thanks to the Father, who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in light. He has delivered us from the dominion of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. He is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of all creation; for in him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or authorities &mdash; all things were created through him and for him. He is before all things, and in him all things hold together. He is the head of the body, the Church; he is the beginning, the first-born from the dead, that in everything he might be pre-eminent. For in him all the fulness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross.<br />

At that time: The rulers scoffed at Jesus, saying, &ldquo;He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, his Chosen One!&rdquo; The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him vinegar, and saying, &ldquo;If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!&rdquo; There was also an inscription over him, &ldquo;This is the King of the Jews.&rdquo; One of the criminals who were hanged railed at him, saying, &ldquo;Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!&rdquo;&nbsp; But the other rebuked him, saying, &ldquo;Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed justly; for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.&rdquo; And he said,&ldquo; Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingly power.&rdquo;And he said to him,&ldquo;Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.&rdquo;<br />

<em>They had the name of Christ and his Father written on their foreheads.</em><br />
<br />
I, John, looked, and behold, on Mount Zion stood the Lamb, and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand who had his name and his Father&rsquo;s name written on their foreheads. And I heard a voice from heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder; the voice I heard was like the sound of harpists playing on their harps, and they sing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and before the elders. No one could learn that song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been redeemed from the earth. It is these who follow the Lamb where ever he goes; these have been redeemed from mankind as first fruits for God and the Lamb, and in their mouth no lie was found, for they are spotless.<br />

Then another angel came out from the altar, the angel who has power over fire, and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, &ldquo;Put in your sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for its grapes are ripe.&rdquo; So the angel swung his sickle on the earth and gathered the vintage of the earth, and threw it into the great wine press of the wrath of God.<br />

I, John, saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain. And he seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, and threw him into the pit, and shut it and sea led it over him, that he should deceive the nations nomore, till the thousand years were ended. After that he must be let out for a little while. Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom judgement was committed. Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony to Jesus and for the word of God, and who had not worshipped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life, and reigned with Christ a thousand years. Then I saw a great white throne and him who sat upon it; from his presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Also another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, by what they had done. And these a gave up the dead in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead in them, and all were judged by what they had done. Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire; and if anyone&rsquo;s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire. Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.<br />

<em>Today&rsquo;s Rosary:The Glorious Mysteries </em></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Sunday: Be Vigilant!</span> All three readings for this Sunday focus on vigilance, not as an agonising wait for the Lord judge at the end of our lives, but as awareness to the presence of the Lord today. The first reading tells us of the new world that will begin with the coming of the Lord. The Gospel urges us to be vigilant so that we may welcome him at his &ldquo;advent.&rdquo; The second reading invites us to open our eyes to discern the signs of the new day which has already dawned.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">FIRST READING</span><br />
<strong>A reading fromthe Book of Isaiah</strong> <span style="color:#b22222">(Isaiah 2:1-5)</span><br />
<em>The Lord will gather all nations in the eternal peace of the Kingdom of God.</em><br />
<br />
The word which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem. It shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established as the highest of the mountains, and shall be raised above the hills; and all the nations shall flow to it, and many peoples shall come, and say: &ldquo;Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths. For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. He shall judge between the nations, and shall decide for many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plough shares, and theirs pears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. O house of Jacob, come, let us walk in the light of the LORD.<br />
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The word of the Lord.</strong></p>

<strong>A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Romans</strong>&nbsp; <span style="color:#b22222">( Romans 13:l1-14a)</span><br />
<em>&ldquo;Salvation is nearer to us now.</em><br />
<br />
Brethren: You know what hour it is, how it is full time now for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed; the night is far gone, the day is at hand. Let us then cast off the works of darkness and put on the armour of light; let us conduct ourselves becomingly as in the day, not in revelling and drunkenness, not in debauchery and licentiousness, not in quarrelling and jealousy. But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh.<br />

<strong>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew</strong> <span style="color:#ff0000">(Matthew 24:37-44)</span><br />
<em>Watch therefore, you must be ready</em><br />
<br />
At that time: Jesus said to his disciples, &ldquo;As were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of man. For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and they did not know until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of man. Then two men will bein the field; one is taken and one is left. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one is taken and one is left. Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. But know this, that if the householder had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have watched and would not have let his house be broken into. Therefore you also must be ready; for the Son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect.&rdquo;<br />

Then the Lord will create over the whole site of Mount Zion and over her assemblies a cloud by day, and smoke and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory there will be a canopy and a pavilion. It will be for a shade by day from the heat, and for a refuge and a shelter from the storm and rain.<br />

On that day: There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots. And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord.

He shall not judge by what his eyes see, or decide by what his ears hear; but with righteousness he shall judge the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the earth; and he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall slay the wicked. Righteousness shall be the belt of his waist, and faithfulness the belt of his loins.

<em>&ldquo;Faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes by the preaching of Christ. &rdquo;</em><br />
<br />
Brethren: If you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For man believes with his heart and so is justified, and he confesses with his lips and so is saved. The Scripture says, &ldquo;No one who believes in him will be put to shame.&rdquo;For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and bestows his riches upon all who call upon him. For, &ldquo;every one who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.&rdquo; But how are men to call upon him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without a preacher? And how can men preach unless they are sent? As it is written, &ldquo;How beautiful are the feet of those who preach good news!&rdquo; But they have not all heeded the gospel; for Isaiah says, &ldquo;Lord, who has believed what he has heard from us?&rdquo; So faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes by the preaching of Christ. But I ask, have they not heard? Indeed they have; for &ldquo;Their voice has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of theworld.&rdquo;<br />

Thus says the Lord God:I sit not yet a very little while until Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be regarded as a forest? In that day the deaf shall hear the words of a book, and out of their gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind shall see. The meek shall obtain fresh joy in the Lord, and the poor among men shall exult in the Holy One of Israel. For the ruthless shall come to nothing and the scoffer cease, and all who watch to do evil shall be cut off, who by a word make a man out to be an offender, and lay a snare for him who reproves in the gate, and with an empty plea turn aside him who is in the right. Therefore thus says the Lord, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: &ldquo;Jacob shall no more be ashamed, no more shall his face grow pale. For when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in his midst, they will sanctify my name; they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.

<strong>A reading from the Book of Isaiah</strong> <span style="color:#b22222">(Isaiah 30:19-21.23-26)</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000"><em>&ldquo;He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry.&rdquo;</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Thus says the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel: Yes, O people in Zion who dwell at Jerusalem; you shall weep no more. He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry; when he hears it, he will answer you. And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet your Teacher will not hide himself any more, but your eyes shall see your Teacher. And your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, &ldquo;This is the way, walk in it,&rdquo; when you turn to the right or when you turn to the left. And he will give rain for the seed with which you sow the ground, and grain, the produce of the ground, which will be rich and plenteous. In that day your flock will be given pasture, and the lamb will graze in open fields; and the oxen and the donkeys that till the ground will eat salted food, which has been winnowed with shovel and fork. And upon every lofty mountain and every high hill there will be brooks running with water, in theday of the great slaughter, when the towers fall. Moreover the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day when the Lose binds up the hurt of his people, and heals the wounds inflicted by his blow.<br />

<span style="color:#ff0000"><em>&ldquo;When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them.&rdquo;</em></span></p>

<p>At that time: Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every infirmity. When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. Then he said to his disciples, &ldquo;The harvest is plentiful, but the labourers are few; pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out labourers into his harvest. &rdquo; And he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every infirmity. These Twelve Jesus sent out, charging them, &ldquo;Go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. And preach asyou go, saying, &lsquo;The kingdom of heaven is at hand. &rsquo; Heal the sick,raise the dead, cleans lepers, cast out demons. You received without pay, give without pay.&rdquo;<br />

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Themw of the Sunday: &quot;Change Your Hearts!&quot;</span> Though the Lord came two thousand years ago, he has not yet come to many places or in to many situations. In today&rsquo;s Gospel the Baptist tells us what we should do to prepareh is way. We should ask ourselves what separates us from our neighbours, what barriers hinder the harmony that should exist in our families, our communities and our nation. The second reading explains what we must foster as members of the Christian community so that the Lord may come. The first reading describes the new world that has already dawned.</p>

On that day: There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots. And the Spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord. And his delight shall be in the fear of the Lord. He shall not judge by what his eyes see, or decide by what his ears hear; but with righteousness he shall judge the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the earth; and he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall slay the wicked. Righteousness shall be the belt of his waist, and faithfulness the belt of his loins.

<strong>A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Romans</strong>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000"><em>Christ saves all men.</em></span><br />
Brethren: Whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that by steadfastness and by the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope. May the God of steadfastness and encouragement grant you to live in such harmony with one another, in accord with Christ Jesus, that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Welcome one another, therefore, as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God. For I tell you that Christ became a servant to the circumcised to show God&rsquo;s truthfulness, in order to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs, and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written, &ldquo;Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles, and sing to your name.&rdquo;<br />

In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, &ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.&rdquo; For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said, &ldquo;The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight .&rdquo; Now John wore a garment of camel&rsquo;s hair, and a leather belt around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey. Then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan, and they were baptised by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, &ldquo;You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruit that befits repentance, and donot presume to say to yourselves, &lsquo;We have Abraham as our father&rsquo;; for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham. Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees; every tree there- fore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. &ldquo;I baptise you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry; he will baptise you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the granary, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.&rdquo;<br />

<em>&ldquo;We have seen strange things today.&rdquo;</em><br />
<br />
On one of those days, as Jesus was teaching, there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was with him to heal. And behold, men were bringing on a bed a man who was paralysed, and they sought to bring him in and lay him before Jesus; but finding no way to bring him in, because of the crowd, they went upon the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into their midst before Jesus. And when he saw their faith he said, &ldquo;Man, your sins are forgiven you. &rdquo;And the scribes and the Pharisees began to question, saying,&ldquo;Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God only?&rdquo; When Jesus perceived their questionings, he answered them, &ldquo;Why do you questionin your hearts? Which is easier, to say,&lsquo;Your sins are forgiven you,&rsquo;or to say,&lsquo;Rise and walk&rsquo;? But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgivesins&rdquo;&nbsp; he said to them an who was paralysed&mdash;&ldquo; I say to you, rise, take up your bed and go home. &rdquo;And immediately he rose before them, and took up that on which he lay, and went home, glorifying God. And amazement seized the mall, and they glorified God and were filled with awe, saying, &ldquo;We have seen strange things today.&rdquo;<br />

Why do you say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, &ldquo;My way is hidden from the Lord, and my right is disregarded by my God&rdquo;? Have you not known? Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary, his understanding is unsearchable. He gives power to the faint, and to him who has no might he increases strength.

He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there will be no end.&rdquo; And Mary said to the angel, &ldquo;How will this be, since I know not man?&rdquo; And the angel said to her, &ldquo;The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will over shadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Sunday: The Signs of the True Messiah.</span> The Gospel tells us that the Baptist doubted that Jesus was the true Messiah. He expected a judge who would be hard on sinners; he saw instead one who tried to save the lost. How can we convince people that the Messiah is among us? Are liturgies, processions and long prayers sufficient? Christ&rsquo;s disciples must be signs of what their master did: they must help others. The first and second readings tell us that if we want to succeed in being such witnesses, we must not allow ourselves to be discouraged, even when confronted by situations that seem desperate.</p>

What then did you go out to see? A prophet. Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is he of whom it is written, &lsquo;Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who shall prepare you way before you. &rsquo; I tell you, among those born of women none is greater than John; yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.&rdquo; (When they heard this all the people and the tax collectors justified God, having been baptised with the baptism of John; but the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the purpose of God for themselves, not having been baptised by him.)<br />

<strong>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke</strong> <span style="color:#b22222">(Luke 1:5-25)</span><br />
<em>The birth of John the Baptist is announced by Gabriel.</em><br />
<br />
In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, of the division of Abijah; and he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blamelessly. But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in years. Now while he was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty, according to the custom of the priesthood, it fell to him by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense. And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense. And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. But the angel said to him, &ldquo;Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer is heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth; for he will be great before the Lord, and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother&rsquo;s womb. And he will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God, and he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.&rdquo; And Zechariah said to the angel, &ldquo;How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.&rdquo; And the angel answered him,&ldquo; I am Gabriel, who stand in the presence of God; and I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news. And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things come to pass, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time. &rdquo;And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they wondered at his delay in the temple. And when he came out, he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple; and he made signs to them and remained mute. And when his time of service was ended, he went to his home. After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she hid herself, saying, &ldquo;Thus the Lord has done to me in the days when he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.&rdquo;<br />

In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin&rsquo;s name was Mary. And he came to her and said, &ldquo;Hail, full of grace, the Lord is With you! &rdquo;But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered in her mind what sort of greeting this might be. And the angel said to her, &ldquo;Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there will be no end.&rdquo; And Mary said to the angel, &ldquo;How will this be, since I know not man?&rdquo; And the angel said to her, &ldquo;The Holy Spirit will come upon, you, and the power of the Most High will over shadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God. And behold, your kins woman Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. For with God nothing will be impossible.&rdquo;And Mary said, &ldquo;Behold, I am the hand maid of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word. &rdquo;And the angel departed from her<br />

And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote,&ldquo;His name is John.&rdquo; And they all marvelled. And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, blessing God. And fear came on all their neighbours.

And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways, to give knowledge of salvation to his people in the forgiveness of their sins, through the tender mercy of our God, when the day shall dawn upon us from on high to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.&rdquo;<br />

Beloved: When the goodness and loving kindness of God our Saviour appeared, he saved us, not because of deeds done by us in righteousness, but in virtue of his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal in the Holy Spirit, which he poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour, so that we might be justified by his grace and become heirs in hope of eternal life.<br />

When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another,Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us. And they went with haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger. And when they saw it they made known the saying which had been told them concerning this child; and all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them. But Mary kept all these things, pondering them in her heart. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.<br />

In those days: Stephen, full of grace and power, did great wonders and signs among the people. Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and Asia, arose and disputed with Stephen. But they could not with stand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke. Now when they heard these things they were enraged, and they ground their teeth against him. But he, full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God,and Jesus standing at the right hand of God; and he said, &ldquo;Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God. But they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and rushed together upon him. Then they cast him out of the city and stoned him; and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul. And as they were stoning Stephen, he prayed, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.<br />

<br />
Beloved: This is the message we have heard from Jesus Christ and proclaim to you, that God is light and in him is no darkness at all. If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not live according to the truth; but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just, and will forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we saywe have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. My little children, I am writing this to you so that you may not sin; but if any one does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; and he is the expiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world.<br />

Beloved: By this we may be sure that we know Jesus Christ, if we keep his commandments.

Beloved, I am writing you no new commandment, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning; the old commandment is the word which you have heard. Yet I am writing you a new commandment, which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining.

When the time came for their purification according to the law of Moses, the parents of Jesus brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord (as it is written in the law of the Lord, &ldquo;Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord&rdquo;) and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord, &ldquo;a pair of turtle doves, or two young pigeons.&rdquo; Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. And it had been revealed to himby the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord&rsquo;s Christ. And inspired by the Spirit he came into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the law, he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said,&ldquo;Lord, now let your servant depart in peace, according to your word; for my eyes have seen your salvation which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your people Israel.&rdquo;And his father and his mother marvelled at what was said about him; and Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, &ldquo;Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is spoken against (and a sword will pierce through your own soul also), that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed.&rdquo;<br />

The Lord honoured the father above the children, and he confirmed the right of the mother over her sons. Whoever honours his father atones for sins, and preserves himself from them.

Whoever glorifies his father will have long life, and whoever obeys the Lord will refresh his mother. O son, help your father in his old age,and donot grieve him as long as he lives; even if he is lacking in understanding, show forbearance; and do not despise him all the days of his life. For kindness to a father will not be forgotten, and against your sins it will be credited to you a house raised in justice to you.<br />

And over all these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony. And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in the one body. And be thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, as you teach and admonish one another in all wisdom, and as you sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs with thankfulness in your hearts to God.

<strong>The beginning of the holy Gospel according to John</strong> <span style="color:#b22222">(John 1:1-18)</span><br />
<em>&ldquo;The Word became flesh. &rdquo;</em><br />
<br />
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God; all things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. He came for testimony, to bear witness to the light, that all might believe through him. He was not the light, but came tobear witness to the light. The true light that enlightens every man was coming into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world knew him not. He came to his own home, and his own people received him not. But to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God; who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God. And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth; we have beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten Son from the Father.(John bore witness to him, and cried, &ldquo;This was he of whom I said, &lsquo;He who comes after me ranks before me, for he was before me.&rdquo;&rsquo;)&nbsp; And from his fullness have we all received, grace upon grace.For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has made him known.<br />

<p><em>Mass for Peace may be said if the ordinary judges fits and in accordance with the theme indicated by the Holy See.<br />

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Theme of the Feast</strong>: <span style="color:#ff0000">Mary, Mother of the Prince of Peace</span>. On the first of January Christians celebrate several festive events. We celebrate, first of all, New Year Day; then we think of the circumcision of Jesus which took place, Luke tells us, eight days after his birth (2:21); the day was later on dedicated to Mary Mother of God, and finally in 1968 Pope Paul VI chose January 1st as the &ldquo;World Day of Peace.&rdquo; The person in charge of proclaiming the Word should choose just one theme. The themes are: the blessing (1st reading); Mary, model of all mothers (Gospel); peace (1st reading and Gospel); our divine sonship (2nd reading); wonder and astonishment at the great love of God (Gospel).</p>

And when they saw it they made known the saying which had been told them concerning this child; and all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them. But Mary kept all these things, pondering them in her heart. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them. And at the end of eight days, when he was circumcised, he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</p>

<em>What you heard from the beginning abides in you.</em><br />
Beloved: Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son. Anyone who denies the Son does not have the Father. He who confesses the Son has the Father also. Let what you heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then you will abide in the Son and in the Father. And this is what he has promised us, eternal life. I write this to you about those who would deceive you; but the anointing which you received from him abides in you, and you have no need that any one should teach you; as his anointing teaches you about everything, and is true, and is no lie, just as it has taught you, abide in him.

This is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you? He confessed, he did not deny, but confessed, &ldquo;I am not the Christ. And they asked him, &ldquo;What then? Are you Elijah?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I am not.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you the prophet?&rdquo; And he answered, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; They said to him then, &ldquo;Who are you? Let us have an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, &lsquo;Make straight the way of the Lord, &rsquo;as the prophet Isaiah said.&rdquo; Now they had been sent from the Pharisees. They asked him, &ldquo;Then why are you baptising, if you are neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?&rdquo; John answered them, &ldquo;I baptise with water; but among you stands one whom you do not know, even he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.&rdquo; This took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptising.</p>

<em>Anyone who abides in him does not sin.</em><br />
Beloved: If you know that God is righteous, you may be sure that everyone who does right is born of him. See what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him. Beloved, we are God&rsquo;s children now; it does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure. Everyone who commits sin is guilty of lawlessness; sin is lawlessness. You know that he appeared to take away sins, and in him there is no sin. Anyone who abides in him does not sin; anyone who sins has not seen him, nor has he known him.</p>

Little children, let no one deceive you. He who does right is righteous, as he is righteous.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A reading from the first Letter of Saint John (I John 3:11-21)</strong><br />
<em>We have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren.&rdquo;</em><br />
Beloved: This is the message which you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another, and not be like Cain who was of the Evil One and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother&rsquo;s righteous. Do not wonder, brethren, that the world hates you. We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love remains in death. Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. By this we show love, that he laid down his life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. But if anyone has the world&rsquo;s goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God&rsquo;s love abide in him? Little children, let us not love in word or speech but indeed and in truth. By this we shall know that we are of the truth, and reassure our hearts before him whenever our hearts condemn us; for God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything. Beloved, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God</p>

<em>You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">At that time: Jesus decided to go to Galilee. And he found Philip and said to him, Follow me. Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, We have found him of whom Moses in the law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. Nathanael said to him, Can anything good come out of Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see. Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said of him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! Nathanael said to him, How do you know me? Jesus answered him, Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you. Nathanael answered him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel! Jesus answered him, Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You shall see greater things than these. And he said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</p>

<em>The Spirit, the water, and the blood.</em><br />
Beloved: Who is it that overcomes the world but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? This is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ, not with the water only but with the water and the blood. And the Spirit is the witness, because the Spirit is the truth. There are three witnesses, the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three agree. If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; for this is the testimony of God that he has borne witness to his Son. He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. He who does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has borne to his Son. And this is the testimony that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He who has the Son has life; he who has not the Son of God has not life. I write this to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life.</p>

<strong>A reading from the first Letter of Saint John (1 John 5: 14-21)</strong><br />
<em>He hears us in whatever we ask.</em><br />
Beloved: This is the confidence which we have in the Son of God, that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us. And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have obtained the requests made of him. If anyone sees his brother committing what is not a deadly sin, he will ask, and God will give him life for those whose sin is not deadly. There is sin which is deadly; I do not say that one is to pray for that. All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin which is not deadly. We know that anyone born of God does not sin, but He who was born of God keeps him, and the Evil One does not touch him. We know that we are of God, and the whole world is in the power of the Evil One. And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, to know him who is true; and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. Little children, keep yourselves from idols.</p>

<strong>A reading from the holy Gospel according to John</strong><br />
At that time: There was a marriage at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there; Jesus also was invited to the marriage, with his disciples. When the wine failed, the mother of Jesus said to him, They have no wine. And Jesus said to her, O woman, what is that to you or to me? My hour has not yet come. His mother said to the servants, Do whatever he tells you. Now six stone jars were standing there, for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. Jesus said to them, Fill the jars with water. And they filled them up to the brim. He said to them, Now draw some out, and take it to the steward of the feast. So they took it. When the steward of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the steward of the feast called the bridegroom and said to him, Every man serves the good wine first; and when men have drunk freely, then the poor wine; but you have kept the good wine until now. This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed in him.</p>

<p><strong>Theme of the Feast: Jesus,</strong> <span style="color:#ff0000">The Star that Guides All People. </span>The feast of the Epiphany was first celebrated in Africa, in Egypt, where it replaced a pagan feast that celebrated the victory of light over darkness. The Christian liturgy took over this theme and proposes it for our reflection in the first reading and in the Gospel. The second reading tells us what would happen if we accept the light: we would become one people.<br />
The feast of the Baptism of the Lord is not celebrated this year. The feast of the Baptism of the Lord traditionally marks the End of Christmas season as well as beginning of the ORDINARY TIME of the church Liturgical Calendar.</p>

For we have seen his star in the East, and have come to worship him. When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him; and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. They told him, In Bethlehem of Judea; for so it is written by the prophet: And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who will govern my people Israel. Then Herod summoned the Wise Men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star appeared; and he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him bring me word, that I too may come and worship him.&rdquo; When they had heard the king they went &nbsp;their &nbsp;way; and behold, &nbsp;the &nbsp;star which &nbsp;they &nbsp;had &nbsp;seen &nbsp;in the East went before them, till it came to rest over the place where the child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy; and going into the house they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshipped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh. And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way.</p>

<em>&ldquo;He has spoken to us by a Son. &rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br />
In many and various ways God spoke of old to &nbsp;our fathers by &nbsp;the prophets; but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the ages. He reflects the glory of God and bears the very stamp of his nature, upholding the universe by his word of power. &nbsp;When he had made purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, having become as much superior to angels as the name he has obtained is more excellent than theirs. For to what angel did God ever say, &ldquo;You are my Son, today I have begotten you&rdquo;? Or again, &ldquo;I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son&rdquo;? And again, when he brings the first-born into the world, he says, &ldquo;Let all God&rsquo;s angels worship him.&rdquo;</p>

And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Follow me and I will make you become fishers of men.&rdquo; And immediately they left their nets and followed him. And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in their boat mending the nets. And immediately he called them; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and followed him.</p>

<em>&ldquo;It&nbsp; &nbsp;was fitting that </em><em>he should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through suffering.&rdquo;</em><br />
It was not to angels that God subjected the world to come, of which we are speaking. It has been testified somewhere, &ldquo;What is man that you are mindful of him, or the son of man, that you care for him? You made him for a little while lower than the angels, You have crowned him with glory and honour, putting everything in subjection under his feet.&rdquo; Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing outside his control. As it is, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him. But we see Jesus, who&nbsp; for a little while was made lower than the angels, crowned with glory and honour because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone. For it was fitting that he, for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through suffering. For he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified have all one origin. That is why he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying, &ldquo;I will proclaim your name to my brethren, in the midst of the congregation I will praise you!&rdquo;</p>

And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an un- clean spirit; and he cried out, &ldquo;What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, the Holy One of God.&rdquo; But Jesus rebuked him, saying, &ldquo;Be silent, and come out of him!&rdquo; And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, &ldquo;What is this? A new teaching! With authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.&rdquo; And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee.</p>

<em>&ldquo;He </em><em>had </em><em>to be made like his brethren in every respect, so that he might become merciful.&rdquo;</em><br />
Since the children share in flesh and blood, Jesus himself likewise partook of the same nature, that through death he might destroy him who has the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong bondage. For surely it is not with angels that he is concerned but with the descendants of Abraham. Therefore he had to be made like his brethren in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make expiation for the sins of the people. For because he himself has suffered and been tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.</p>

And Simon and those who were with him followed him, and they found him and said to him, &ldquo;Everyone is searching for you.&rdquo; And he said to them, &ldquo;Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also; for that is why I came out.&rdquo; And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.</p>

<strong>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark (Mark 1:40-45)</strong><br />
<em>The leprosy left him, and he was wade clean.</em><br />
At that time: A leper came to Jesus begging him, and kneeling said to him, &ldquo;If you will, you can make me clean.&rdquo; Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him, and said to him, &ldquo;I will; be clean.&rdquo; And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean. And he sternly charged him, and sent him away at once, and said to him, &ldquo;See that you say nothing to any one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a proof to the people.&rdquo; But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was out in the country; and people came to him from every quarter.</p>

<em>&ldquo;Let </em><em>us </em><em>therefore strive to enter that rest. &rdquo;</em><br />
Brethren: While the promise of entering his rest remains, let us fear lest any of you be judged to have failed to reach it. For good news came to us just as to them; but the message which they heard did not benefit them,&nbsp; because&nbsp; it did not meet&nbsp; with&nbsp; faith&nbsp; in the hearers. For we who have believed enter that rest,&nbsp; as he&nbsp; has said, &ldquo;As I swore in my wrath, &lsquo;They shall never enter my rest, &rdquo;&rsquo; although his works were finished from the foundation of the world. For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way, &ldquo;And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.&rdquo; And again in this place he said, &ldquo;They shall never enter my rest.&rdquo; Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, that no one fall by the same sort of disobedience.</p>

<em>&nbsp;&ldquo;The </em><em>Son </em><em>of </em><em>man </em><em>has </em><em>authority </em><em>on </em><em>earth </em><em>to forgive </em><em>sins. </em><em>&rdquo;</em><br />
When Jesus returned to Capemaum after some days,&nbsp; it&nbsp; was&nbsp; reported that he was at home. And many were gathered together, so that there was no longer room for them, not even about the door; and he was preaching the word to them. And they came, bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men. And when they could not get near him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him; and when they had made an opening, they let down the pallet on which the paralytic lay. And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, &ldquo;Child, your sins are forgiven.&rdquo; Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts, &ldquo;Why does this man speak like this? It is blasphemy! Who can forgive sins but God alone?&rdquo; And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they questioned like this within themselves, said to them, &ldquo;Why do you question like this in your hearts? Which is easier, to say&nbsp; to the paralytic, &lsquo;Your sins are forgiven, &rsquo; or to say, &lsquo;Rise, take up your pallet and walk&rsquo;? But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins&rdquo;&mdash; he said to the paralytic&mdash; &ldquo;I say to you, rise, take up your pallet and go home.&rdquo; And he rose, and immediately took up the pallet and went out before them all; so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, &ldquo;We never saw anything like this!&rdquo;</p>

<strong>A reading from the Letter to the Hebrews (Hebrews 4: 12-16)</strong><br />
<em>&ldquo;Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace.&rdquo;</em><br />
Brethren: The word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. And before him no creature is hidden, but all are open and laid bare to the eyes of him with whom we have to do. Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. For we have not a high priest who is unable to sympathise with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sinning. Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</p>

And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, &ldquo;Why does he eat with the tax collectors and sinners?&rdquo; And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, &ldquo;Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick; I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.&rdquo;</p>

<strong>A reading from the Letter to the Hebrews &nbsp; &nbsp;(Hebrews 5: 1- 10)</strong><br />
<em>&ldquo;Although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered,&rdquo;</em><br />
Every high priest chosen from among men is appointed to act on behalf of men in relation to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. He can deal gently with the ignorant and wayward, since he himself is beset with weakness. Because of this he is bound to offer sacrifice for his own sins as well as for those of the people. And one does not take the honour upon himself, but he is called by God, just as Aaron was. So also Christ did not exalt himself to be made a high priest, but was appointed by him who said to him, &ldquo;You are my Son, today I have begotten you&rdquo;; as he says also in another place, &ldquo;You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.&rdquo; In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers&lsquo; and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to him &nbsp;who &nbsp;was &nbsp;able to save him from death, and he was heard for his godly fear. Although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered; and being made perfect he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him, being designated by God a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.</p>

At that time: John&rsquo;s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting; and people came and said to him, &ldquo;Why do John&rsquo;s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?&rdquo; And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. The days will come, when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day. No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; if he does, the patch tears away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear is made. And no one puts new wine into old wineskins ; if he does, the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost, and so are the skins; but new wine is for fresh skins.&rdquo;</p>

<strong>A reading from the Letter to the Hebrews &nbsp; (Hebrews 6: 10-20)</strong><br />
<em>We have this hope as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul.</em><br />
Brethren: God is not so unjust as to overlook your work and the love &nbsp;which you showed for his sake in serving &nbsp;the saints, as you still do. And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness in realising the full assurance of hope until the end, so that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises. For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater by whom to swear, he swore by himself, saying, &ldquo;Surely I will bless you and multiply you.&rdquo; And thus Abraham, having patiently endured, obtained the promise. Men indeed swear by a greater than themselves, and in all their disputes an oath is final for confirmation. So when God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose, he interposed with an oath, so that through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible that God should prove false, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to seize the hope set before us. We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into the inner shrine behind the curtain, where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.</p>

<em>You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek. &rdquo;</em><br />
<strong>A reading from the Letter to the Hebrews (Hebrews 7:1-3.15-17)</strong><br />
Brethren: Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, met Abraham returning from the &nbsp;slaughter &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;kings and blessed him; and to him Abraham &nbsp;apportioned &nbsp;a tenth &nbsp;part of everything. He is first, by translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then he is also king of Salem, that is, king of peace. He is without father or mother or genealogy, and has neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God he continues a priest forever. This becomes even more evident when another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek, who has become a priest, not according to a legal requirement concerning bodily descent but by the power of an indestructible life. For it is witnessed of him, You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.</p>

And he looked around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, and said to the man, &ldquo;Stretch &nbsp;out your &nbsp;hand. He stretched it out, and his hand was restored. The Pharisees went out, and immediately held counsel with the Herodians against him, how to destroy him.</p>

<strong>A reading from the Letter to the Hebrews &nbsp; (Hebrews 7:25&mdash;8 :6)</strong><br />
<em>He offered sacrifices when he offered up himself.</em><br />
Brethren: Jesus is able for all time to save those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them. For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, blameless, unstained, separated from sinners, exalted above the heavens. He has no need, like those high priests, to offer sacrifices daily, first for his own sins and then for those of the people; he did this once for all when he offered up himself. Indeed, the law appoints men in their weakness as high priests, but the word of the oath, which came later than the law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever. Now the point in what we are saying is this: we have such a high priest, one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven, a minister in the sanctuary and the true tent which is set up not by man but by the Lord. For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; hence it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer. Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law. They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary; for when Moses was about to erect the tent, he was instructed by God, saying, &ldquo;See that you make everything according to the pattern which was shown you on the mountain.&rdquo; But as it is, Christ has obtained a ministry which is as much more excellent than the old as the covenant he mediates is better, since it is enacted on better promises.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Father Cyprian Michael Iwene Tansi was born in Nigeria in 1903. </strong>He was brought up by the missionaries and trained as a teacher and a catechist. Later he decided to join the seminary and in 1937 he was ordained a priest. In 1950 he left his Diocese in order to go to England where he joined the Cistercian Abbey of Mount St Bernard. He had been singled out as the ideal candidate to be trained in England and then return to establish a Trappist Monastery in the Diocese of Onitsha in Nigeria. Fr Tansi lived the monastic life with great faith and humility. Absorbed in prayer, he was a living example of patience and charity. Early in 1964 he was diagnosed with aortic aneurysm and died two weeks later on 20 January, 1964.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Be of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind.</em><br />
Brethren: if there is any encouragement in Christ, any incentive of love, any participation in the Spirit, any affections and sympathy, complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. Do nothing from selfishness or conceit, but in humility count others better &nbsp;than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his &nbsp;own interests, &nbsp;but &nbsp;also to the interests of others. Have this mind among yourselves, which was in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness &nbsp;of men. And being found in human form he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly &nbsp;exalted him and bestowed on him the name which is &nbsp;above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>

<em>He entered once for all into the Holy Place, taking his own blood.</em><br />
Brethren: A tent was prepared, the outer one, in which were the lampstand and the table and the bread of offering; it is called the Holy Place. Behind the second curtain stood a tent called the Holy of Holies. But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and more perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation) &nbsp;he entered once for all into the Holy place, taking not the blood of goats and calves but his &nbsp;own blood, &nbsp;thus securing an eternal redemption. For if the sprinkling. of defiled persons with the blood of goats and bulls and with the ashes of a heifer sanctifies for the purification of the flesh, how much more shall the blood &nbsp;of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself &nbsp;without blemish to God, purify your conscience from dead works to serve the living God.</p>

<strong>Vespers II of the following Sunday</strong></p>

<p><strong>Theme of the Sunday:</strong> <span style="color:#ff0000">The Light of Christ Begins to Shine.</span> Jesus started his public ministry in Galilee, considered a land of pagans, a people held in contempt by other Jews. At the end of his gospel Matthew says that it was from a mountain in Galilee that Jesus sent his disciples. The light that shone out from Galilee is destined to illumine people all over the world. The first reading stresses this universality of the Church and shows how this had been foretold by the prophet. The second reading provides an example of a community in which there are divisions because people refuse to accept each other&rsquo;s ideas.</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000">FIRST READING</span><br />
<strong>A reading from the Book of Isaiah (Isaiah 9 : 1-4)</strong><br />
<em>In Galilee of the nations, the people have seen a great light.</em><br />
In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the latter time he will make glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations. The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shined. You have multiplied the nation, you have increased its joy; they rejoice before you as with joy at the harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the spoil. For the yoke of his burden, and the staff for his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, you have broken as on the day of Midian.</p>

I appeal to you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree and that there be no dissensions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same judgement. For it has been reported to me by Chloes people that there is quarrelling among you, my brethren. What I mean is that each one of you says, &ldquo;I belong to Paul,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I belong to Apollos,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I belong to Cephas,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I belong to Christ.&rdquo; Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptised in the name of Paul?

And he said to them, &ldquo;Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.&rdquo; Immediately they left their nets and followed him. And going on from there he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and he called them.

<strong>A reading from the Letter to the Hebrews (Hebrews 9 : 15.24-28)</strong><br />
<em>He has been offered once to bear the sins of many, he will appear a second time to those who are eagerly waiting for him.</em><br />
Brethren: Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, since a death has occurred which redeems them from the transgressions under the first covenant. For Christ has entered, not into a sanctuary made with hands, a copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf. Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the Holy Place yearly with blood not his own; for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the age to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. And just as it is appointed for men to die once, and after that comes judgement, so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him.</p>

If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end. But no one can enter a strong man&rsquo;s house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man; then indeed he may plunder his house. &ldquo;Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they utter; but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin&rdquo; &nbsp;for they had said, &ldquo;He has an unclean spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<em>&ldquo;Behold, I have come to do your will, O God. &rdquo;</em><br />
<strong>A reading from the Letter to the Hebrews (Hebrews 10:1-10)</strong><br />
Brethren: &nbsp;Since the &nbsp;law has but &nbsp;a &nbsp;shadow &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;good &nbsp;things &nbsp;to come instead of the true form of these realities, it can never, &nbsp;by the same sacrifices which are continually &nbsp;offered &nbsp;year after &nbsp;year, make perfect those who draw near. Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered? If the worshippers had once been cleansed, they would no longer have any consciousness of sin. But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sin year after year. For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins. Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said, &ldquo;Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired, but a body you have prepared for me; in burnt offerings and sin offerings you have taken no pleasure. Then I said, &lsquo;Behold, I have come to do your will, O God,&rsquo; as it is written of me in the roll of the book.&rdquo; When he said above, &ldquo;You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings&rdquo; (these are offered according to the law), then he added, &ldquo;Behold, I have come to do your will.&rdquo; &nbsp;He abolishes the first in order to establish the second.

In those days: Paul said to the people [in Jerusalem], &ldquo;I am a Jew, born at Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, educated according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God as you all are this day. I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering to prison both men and women, as the high priest and the whole council of elders bear me witness. From them I received letters to the brethren, and I journeyed to Damascus to take those also who were there and bring them in bonds to Jerusalem to be punished. As I made my journey and drew near to Damascus, about noon a great light from heaven suddenly shone about me. And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, &lsquo;Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?&rsquo; And I answered, &lsquo;Who are you, Lord?&rsquo; And he said to me, &lsquo;I am Jesus of Nazareth whom you are persecuting.&rsquo; Now those who were with me saw the light but did not hear the voice of the one who was speaking to me. And I said, &lsquo;What shall I do, Lord?&rsquo; And the Lord said to me, &lsquo;Rise, and go into Damascus, and there you will be told all that is appointed for you to do.&rsquo; And when I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and came into Damascus. And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, &nbsp;well spoken of &nbsp;by all the Jews who lived there, came to me, and standing by me said to me, &lsquo;Brother Saul, receive your sight.&rsquo; And in that very hour I received my sight and saw him. And he said, &lsquo;The God of our fathers appointed you to know his will, to see the Just One and to hear a voice from his mouth; for you will be a witness for him to all men of &nbsp;what you have seen and heard. And now why do you wait? Rise and be baptised, and wash away your sins, calling on his name.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<em>&lsquo;You </em><em>will </em><em>be told </em><em>what </em><em>you are to do. &rdquo;</em><br />
<strong>A reading&nbsp; from the Acts of the&nbsp; Apostles&nbsp;9:1-22</strong><br />
In those days: Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. Now as he journeyed he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed about him. And he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, &ldquo;Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Who are you, Lord?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting; but rise and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do.&rdquo; The men who were travelling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one. Saul arose from the ground; and when his eyes were opened, he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. And for three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank. Now there was a disciple at Damascus name Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, &ldquo;Ananias.&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Here I am, Lord.&rdquo; And the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Rise and go to the street called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for a man of Tarsus named Saul; for behold, he is praying, and he has seen a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.&rdquo; But &nbsp;Ananias answered, &ldquo;Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem; and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call upon your name.&rdquo; But the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel; for I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.&rdquo; So Ananias departed and entered the house. And laying his hands on him he said, &ldquo;Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has sent me that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes and he regained his sight. Then he rose and was baptised, and took food and was strengthened. For several days he was with the disciples at Damascus. And in the synagogues immediately he proclaimed Jesus, saying, &ldquo;He is the Son of God.&rdquo; And all who heard hint were amazed, and said, &ldquo;Is not this the man who made havoc in Jerusalem of those who called on this name? And he has come here for this purpose, to bring them bound before the chief priests.&rdquo; But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus was the Christ.</p>

<span style="color:#ff0000">Today we honour two close collaborators of Saint Paul.</span> It is good to see that Paul did not carry out his ministry alone. Rather he surrounded himself with several co-operators, both men and women. Timothy and Titus are among the most outstanding of these collaborators.

I thank God whom I serve with a clear conscience, as did my fathers, when I remember you constantly in my prayers. As I remember your tears, I long night and day to see you, that I may be filled with joy. I am reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, dwells in you. For this reason I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands; for God did not give us a spirit of timidity but a spirit of power and love and self-control. Do not be ashamed then of testifying to our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but take your share of suffering for the Gospel in the power of God.</p>

<strong>A reading from the Letter to the Hebrews (Hebrews 10:32-39)</strong><br />
<em>You </em><em>endured </em><em>a </em><em>hard struggle. Therefore do not throw away your confidence.</em><br />
Brethren: Recall the former days when, after you were enlightened, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings, sometimes being publicly exposed to abuse and affliction, and sometimes being partners with those so treated. For you had compassion on the prisoners, and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property, since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one. Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward. For you have need of endurance, so that you may do the will of God and receive what is promised. &ldquo;For yet a little while, and the coming one shall come and shall not tariy; but my righteous one shall live by faith, and if&lsquo; he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him.&rdquo; But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and keep their souls.</p>

The earth produces of itself, first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. But when the grain is ripe, at once he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable shall we use for it? It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when sown upon the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth; yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs, and puts forth large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its&nbsp; shade.&rdquo; With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it; he did not speak to them without a parable, but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.</p>

<strong>A reading from the Letter to the Hebrews<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; (</em>Hebrews 11 : 1-2.8- 19)</strong><br />
<em>&ldquo;He </em><em>looked </em><em>forward to the city whose builder and maker is God.&rdquo;</em><br />
Brethren: Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. For by it the men of old received divine approval. By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place which he was to receive as an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was to go. By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs with him of the same promise. For he looked forward to the city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God. By faith Sarah herself received power to conceive, even when she was past the age, since she considered him faithful who had promised. Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born descendants as many as the stars of heaven and as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore. These all died in faith, not having received what was promised, but having seen it and greeted it from afar, and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. For people who speak thus make it clear that they are seeking a homeland. If they had been thinking of that land from which they had gone out, they would have had opportunity to return. But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city. By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was ready to offer up his only-begotten son, of whom it was said, &ldquo;Through Isaac shall your descendants be named.&rdquo; He considered that God was able to raise men even from the dead; hence he did receive him back and this was a symbol.</p>

On that day, when evening had come, Jesus said to his disciples, &ldquo;Let us go across to the other side.&rdquo; And leaving the crowd, they took him with them, just as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him. And a great storm of wind arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the boat was already filling. But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they woke him up and said to him, &ldquo;Teacher, do you not care if we perish?&rdquo; And he awoke and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, &ldquo;Peace! Be still!&rdquo; And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. He said to them, &ldquo;Why are you afraid? Have you no faith?&rdquo; And they were filled with awe, and said to one another, &ldquo;Who then is this, that even wind and sea obey him?&rdquo;</p>

The beatitudes could all be summed up in the first, Happy the poor.&rdquo; To be poor, however, does not mean to possess nothing. We must be &ldquo;poor in spirit,&rdquo; which means that we must choose to renounce the accumulation of goods, not to use one&rsquo;s capabilities and qualities selfishly and to place one&rsquo;s possessions at the service of others.

<em>Through faith they conquered kingdoms. God will provide something better for us.</em><br />
<strong>A reading&nbsp; from&nbsp; the Letter&nbsp; to the Hebrews&nbsp;11:32-40&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;<br />
Brethren: What more shall I say? For time would fail me to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets who through faith conquered kingdoms, enforced justice, received promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched raging&nbsp; fire, escaped the&nbsp; edge of the&nbsp; sword, won&nbsp; strength out of weakness,&nbsp; became&nbsp; mighty&nbsp; in war, put&nbsp; foreign&nbsp; armies&nbsp; to flight. Women received their dead by resurrection. Some were tortured, refusing to accept release, that they might rise again to a better life. Others suffered mocking and scourging, and even chains and imprisonment. They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were killed with the sword; they went about in skins of sheep and goats, destitute, afflicted, ill-treated &mdash; of whom the world was not worthy wandering over deserts and mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Come out of the man, you unclean spirit.</em><br />
<strong>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark&nbsp;5 : 1-20</strong><br />
At that time: Jesus and his disciples came to the other side of the&nbsp; sea, to the country of the Gerasenes. And when he had come out of the boat, there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, who lived among the tombs; and no one&nbsp; could bind him anymore, even with a chain; for he had often been bound with shackles and chains, but the chains he wrenched apart, and the shackles he broke in pieces; and no one had the strength to subdue him. Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out, and&nbsp; bruising&nbsp; himself&nbsp; with&nbsp; stones.&nbsp; And&nbsp; when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and worshipped him; and crying out with a loud voice, he said, &ldquo;What have you to&nbsp; do&nbsp; with&nbsp; me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, do not torment me.&rdquo; For he had said to him, &ldquo;Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!&rdquo; And Jesus asked him, &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;My name is Legion; for we are many.&rdquo; And he&nbsp; &nbsp;begged him eagerly&rsquo; not to send them out of the country. Now a great herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside; and they begged him, &ldquo;Send us to the swine, let us enter them.&rdquo; So he gave them leave. And the unclean spirits came out, and entered the swine; and the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and were drowned in the sea. The herdsmen fled, and told it in the city and in the country. And people came to see what it was that had happened. And they came to Jesus, and saw the demoniac sitting there, clothed and in his right mind, the man who had had the legion; and they were afraid. And those who had seen it told what had happened to the demoniac and to the swine. And they began to beg Jesus to depart from their neighbourhood. And as he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed with demons begged him that he might be with him. But he refused, and said to him, &ldquo;Go home to your friends, and tell them how much the Lord has done for, you, and how he has had mercy on you.&rdquo; And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him; and all men marveled.</p>

<em>&ldquo;Let </em><em>us </em><em>run </em><em>with perseverance thee race that is set before us.</em><br />
<strong>A reading from the Letter to the Hebrews (Hebrews 12:1-4)</strong><br />
Brethren: Since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God. Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted. In your struggle against who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted. In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.</p>

<strong>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark 5:21-43</strong><br />
At that time: When Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered about him; and he was beside the sea. Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and seeing him, he fell at his feet, and begged him, saying, &ldquo;My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well, and live. &rdquo;And he went with him. And a great crowd followed him and thronged about him. And there was a woman who had had a flow of blood for twelve years, and who had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better but rather grew worse. She had heard the reports about Jesus, and came up behind him&nbsp; in the crowd and touched&nbsp; his garment. For she said, &ldquo;If I touch even his garments, I shall be made well.&rdquo; And immediately the haemorrhage ceased; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease. And Jesus, perceiving in himself that power had gone forth from him, immediately turned about in the crowd, and said, &ldquo;Who touched my garments?&rdquo; And his disciples said to him, &ldquo;You see the crowd pressing around you, and yet you say, &lsquo;Who touched me?&rdquo;&rsquo; And he looked around to see who had done it. But the woman, knowing what had been done to her, came in fear and trembling and fell down before him, and told him the whole truth. And he said to her, &ldquo;Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your disease.&rdquo; While he was still speaking, there came from the ruler&rsquo;s house some who said, &ldquo;Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?&rdquo; But ignoring what they said, Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue, &ldquo;Do not fear, only believe.&rdquo; And he allowed no one to follow him except Peter and James and John the brother of James. When they came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, he saw a tumult, and people weeping and wailing loudly. And when he had entered, he said&nbsp; to them,-&ldquo;Why do you make a tumult and weep? The child is not dead but&nbsp; sleeping.&rdquo; And they laughed at him. But he put them&nbsp; all outside, and took the child&rsquo;s father and mother and those who were with him, and went in where the child was. Taking her by the hand he said to her, &ldquo;Talitha cumi&rdquo;; which means, &ldquo;Little girl, I say to you, arise.&rdquo; And immediately the girl got up and walked; for she was twelve years old. And immediately they were overcome with amazement. And he strictly charged them that no one should know this, and told them to give her something to eat.</p>

<span style="color:#ff0000"><em>&ldquo;The </em><em>Lord </em><em>disciplines </em><em>him </em><em>whom </em><em>he </em><em>loves.</em><em>&rdquo;</em></span><br />
<strong>A reading from the Letter to the Hebrews </strong><strong>12:4-7.11-15</strong><br />
Brethren: In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. And have you forgotten the exhortation which addresses you as sons? &mdash; &ldquo;My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor lose courage when you are punished by him. For the Lord disciplines him whom he loves, and chastises every son whom he receives.&rdquo; It is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline? For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant; later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it. Therefore lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees, and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but rather be healed. Strive for peace with all men, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord. See to&nbsp; it that no one fail to obtain the grace of God; that&nbsp; no &ldquo;root of bitterness&rdquo; spring up and cause trouble, and by it the many become defiled.</p>

What mighty works are wrought by his hands! Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon, and are not his sisters here with us?&rdquo; And they took offence at him. And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;A prophet is not without honour, except in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.&rdquo; And he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands upon a few sick people and healed them. And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went about among the villages teaching.</p>

<span style="color:#ff0000"><em>&ldquo;He had</em> <em>to be made like his brethren in every respect.&rdquo;</em></span><br />
Since the children share in flesh and blood, Jesus himself likewise partook of the same nature, that through death he might destroy him who has the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong bondage. For surely it is not with angels that he is concerned but with the descendants of Abraham. Therefore he had to be made like his brethren in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make expiation for the sins of the people. For because he himself has suffered and been tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.</p>

<span style="color:#ff0000">*</span> When the time came for their purification according to the law of Moses, the parents of Jesus brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord (as it is written in the law of the Lord, &ldquo;Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord&rdquo;) and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord, &ldquo;a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.&rdquo; Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord&rsquo;s Christ. And inspired by the Spirit he came into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the law, he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said,&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord, now let your servant depart in peace, according to your word;&nbsp; for my eyes have seen your&nbsp; salvation which you&nbsp;&nbsp; have prepared in the presence of all peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your people Israel.&rdquo; <span style="color:#ff0000">*</span> And his father and his mother marvelled at what was said about him; and Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, &ldquo;Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is spoken against (and a sword will pierce through your own soul also), that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed.&rdquo; And there goes a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel,&nbsp; of&nbsp; the tribe of Asher; she was of a great age, having lived with her husband seven years from her virginity, and as a widow till she was eighty-four. She did not depart from the temple, worshipping with fasting and prayer night and day. And coming up at that very hour she gave thanks to God, and spoke of him to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem. And &nbsp;when they had performed everything according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth. And the child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom; and the favour of God was upon him.</p>

<strong>A reading from the Letter to the Hebrews, 13: 1-8</strong><br />
Brethren: Let brotherly love continue. Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. Remember those who are in prison, as though in prison with them; and those who are ill-treated, since you also are in the body. Let marriage be held in honour among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled; for God will judge the immoral and adulterous. Keep your life free from love of money, and be content with what you have; for he has said, &ldquo;I will never fail you nor forsake you.&rdquo; Hence we can confidently say, &ldquo;The Lord is my helper, I will not be afraid; what can man do to me?&rdquo; Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God; consider the outcome of their life, and imitate their faith.

<strong>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark</strong><strong> 6</strong><strong>:</strong> <strong>14-29</strong><br />
At that time: King Herod heard of Jesus; for his name had become known. Some said, &ldquo;John the Baptist has been raised from the dead; that is why these powers are at work in him.&rdquo; But others said, &ldquo;It is Elijah.&rdquo; And others said, &ldquo;It is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.&rdquo; But when Herod heard of it he said, &ldquo;John, whom I beheaded, has been raised.&rdquo; For Herod had sent and seized John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip&rsquo;s wife; because he had married her. For John said to Herod, &ldquo;It is not lawful for you to have your brother&#39;s wife.&rdquo; And Herodias had a grudge against him, and wanted to kill him. But she could not, for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard him, he was much perplexed; and yet he heard him gladly. But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his courtiers and officers and the leading men of Galilee. For when Herodias&rsquo; daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests; and the king said to the girl, &ldquo;Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will grant it.&rdquo; And he vowed to her, &ldquo;Whatever you ask me, I will give you, even half of my kingdom.&rdquo; And she went out, and said to her mother, &ldquo;What shall I ask?&rdquo; And she said, &ldquo;The head of John the Baptist.&rdquo; And she came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, saying, &ldquo;I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.&rdquo; And the king was exceedingly sorry; but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her. And immediately the king sent a soldier of the guard and gave orders to bring his head in. He went and beheaded him in the prison, and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother. When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body, and laid it in a tomb.</p>

<strong>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark 6:30-34</strong><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000"><em>&ldquo;They were like sheep without a shepherd.&rdquo;</em></span><br />
At that time: The apostles returned to Jesus, and told him all that they had done and taught. And he said to them, &ldquo;Come away by yourselves to a lonely place, and rest a while.&rdquo; For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat. And they went away in the boat to a lonely place by themselves. Now many saw them going, and knew them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns, and got there ahead of them. As he landed he saw a great throng, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and he began to teach them many things.</p>

<em>Today&rsquo;s Rosary:&nbsp; glorious mystery</em><br />
<strong><em>Vespers II of Sunday</em></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Theme of The Sunday: </strong><span style="color:#ff0000">The Christian Is Salt and Light.</span> The theme of the Sunday is contained in the two parables of the gospel. The figure of light is given more importance than that of salt and, in fact, the first reading refers also to the theme of light. The second reading is related to this theme. Paul states that good works are the sign of the presence of the Spirit. They are the concrete proofs of the truth of the beliefs proclaimed by Christians.</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify;">FIRST READING<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">Your light shall break forth like the dawn.</span><br />
<strong>A reading from the Book of Isaiah, 58:7-10</strong><br />
Thus says the Lord: &ldquo;Share your bread with the hungry, and bring the homeless poor into your house; when you see the naked, cover him, and do not hide yourself from your own flesh. Then shall your light break forth like the dawn, and your healing&nbsp; shall&nbsp; spring up speedily; your righteousness shall go before you, the glory of the Lord shall be your rear guard. Then you shall call, and the Lord will answer; you shall cry, and he will say, Here I am. If you take away from the midst of you the yoke, the pointing of the finger, and speaking wickedness, if you pour yourself out for the hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted, then shall your light rise in the darkness and your gloom be as the noonday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The word of the Lord.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">RESPONSORIAL Psalm 1 I 2:4-5.6-7.8a and 9 (R. 4a)</span><br />
<strong><span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span> &nbsp;A light rises in the darkness for the upright.<br />
Or: Alleluia.</strong></p>

<p>A light rises in the darkness for the upright;<br />
he is generous, merciful and just.<br />
It goes well for the man who deals generously and lends,<br />
who conducts his affairs with justice. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p>He will never be moved;<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">SECOND READING<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000"><em>I have told you of the mystery of Christ crucified&rdquo;</em></span><br />
<strong>A reading from the first Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians, I Corinthians 2:1-5 </strong><br />
When I came to you, brethren, I did not come proclaiming to you the testimony of God in lofty words or wisdom. For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified. And I was with you in weakness and in much fear and trembling; and my speech and my message were not in plausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and power, that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.</p>

At that time:&nbsp; Jesus&nbsp; said&nbsp; to&nbsp; his&nbsp; disciples,&nbsp; &ldquo;You&nbsp; are&nbsp; the&nbsp; salt&nbsp; of&nbsp; the earth; but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trodden under foot by men. You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do men light a lamp and put it under a bushel, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<strong>The beginning of the Book of Genesis 1:1-19</strong><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000"><em>God spoke, and it was so.</em></span><br />
In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of&nbsp; the deep; and the Spirit of God was moving over the face of the waters. And God said, &ldquo;Let there be light&rdquo;; and there was light. And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day. And God said, &ldquo;Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.&rdquo; And God made the firmament and separated the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament. And it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day. And God said, &ldquo;Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.&rdquo; And it was&nbsp; so. God called&nbsp; the dry land Earth,&nbsp; and the waters&nbsp; that were&nbsp; gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good. And God said, &ldquo;Let the earth put forth vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, upon the earth.&rdquo; And it was so. The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their&nbsp; own kinds,&nbsp; and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to&nbsp; its kind. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, a third day. And God said, &ldquo;Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to separate the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years, and let them be lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth.&rdquo; And it was so. And God made the two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; he made the stars also. And God set them in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth, to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.</p>

At that time: When Jesus and his disciples had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret, and moored to the shore. And when they got out of the boat, immediately the people recognised him, and ran about the whole neighbourhood and began to bring sick people on their pallets to any place where they heard he was.

<p style="text-align:justify">FIRST READING<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000"><em>&ldquo;Let us make man in our own image, after our likeness.&rdquo;</em></span><br />
<strong>A reading from the Book of Genesis 1:20-2:4a</strong><br />
And God said, &ldquo;Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the firmament of the heavens.&rdquo; So God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, With which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. And God blessed them, saying, &ldquo;Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.&rdquo; And there was evening and there was morning, a 5fth day. And God said, &ldquo;Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds: cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.&rdquo; And it was so. And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the cattle according to their kinds, and everything that creeps upon the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. Then God said, &ldquo;Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.&rdquo; So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. And God blessed them, and he said to them, &ldquo;Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.&rdquo; And God said, &ldquo;Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food. And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird &#39;of the all, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.&quot; And it has so. And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, a sixth day. Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done. So God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because on it God rested from all his work which he had done in creation. These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created.</p>

<strong>&rdquo;</strong><strong>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark 7:1-13</strong><br />
At that time: When the Pharisees gathered together to Jesus, with some of the scribes, who had come from Jerusalem, they saw that some of his disciples ate with hands defiled, that is, unwashed. (For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, do not eat unless they wash their hands, observing the tradition of the elders; and when they come from the market place, they do not eat unless they purify themselves ; there are many other traditions which they observe, the washing of cups and pots and vessels of bronze.) And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, &ldquo;Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with hands defiled?&rdquo; And he said to them, &ldquo;Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, &lsquo;This people honours me with their lips, but their heart is far from me; in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the precepts of men. &rsquo; You leave the commandment of God, and hold fast the tradition of men.&rdquo; And he said to them, &ldquo;You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God, in order to keep your tradition! For Moses said, &lsquo;Honour your father and your mother and He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him surely die&rsquo;; but you say, &lsquo;If a man tells his father or his mother, What you would have gained from me is Corban&rsquo; (that is, given to God) &mdash; then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother, thus making void the word of God through your tradition which you hand on. And many such things you do.&rdquo;</p>

And he said to them, &ldquo;Then are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes into a man from outside cannot defile him, since it enters, not his heart but his stomach, and so passes on?&rdquo; (Thus he declared all foods clean.) And he said, &ldquo;What comes out of a man is what defiles a man. For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, fornication, theft, murder, adultery, coveting, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, slander, pride, foolishness.

So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall&rsquo; upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh; and the rib which the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man. Then the man said, &ldquo;This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.&rdquo; Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife, and they become one flesh.

He said to the woman, &ldquo;Did God say, &lsquo;You shall not eat of any tree of the garden&rsquo;?&rdquo; And the woman said to the serpent, &ldquo;We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden; but God said, &lsquo;You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.&rdquo;&rsquo; But the serpent said to the woman, &ldquo;You will not die. For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.&rdquo; So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruits and ate; and she also gave some to her husband, and he ate. Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made them- selves aprons. And they heard the sound of the Lose God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lose God among the trees of the garden.</p>

<strong>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark 7:31-37</strong><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000"><em>He makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.</em></span><br />
At that time: Jesus returned from the region of Tyre, and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, through the region of the Decapolis. And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech; and they begged him to lay his hand upon him. And taking him aside from the multitude privately, he put his fingers into his ears, and he spat and touched his tongue; and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, &ldquo;Ephphatha,&rdquo; that is, &ldquo;Be opened.&rdquo; And his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he spoke plainly. And he charged them to tell no one; but the more he charged them, the more zealously they proclaimed it. And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, &ldquo;He has done all things well; he even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.</p>

<span style="color:#ff0000"><em>The Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground.</em></span><br />
The Lord God called to the man, and said to him, &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;I heard the sound of you in the garden, and&nbsp;&nbsp; I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?&rdquo; The man said, &ldquo;The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and&nbsp;&nbsp; I ate.&rdquo; Then the Lord God said to the woman, &ldquo;What is this that you have done?&rdquo; The woman said, &ldquo;The serpent beguiled me, and I ate.&rdquo; The Lord God said to the serpent, &ldquo;Because you have done this, cursed are you above all cattle, and above all wild animals; upon your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days&nbsp; of your life. I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.&rdquo; To the woman he said, &ldquo;I will greatly multiply your pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children, yet your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.&rdquo; And to Adam he said, &ldquo;Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you, &lsquo;You shall not eat of it, &rsquo; cursed is the ground because of you; in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life; thorns and thistles it shall bring forth to you; and you shall eat the plants of the field. In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; you are dust, and to dust you shall return.&rdquo; The man called his wife&rsquo;s name Eve, because she was the mother of all living. And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins, and clothed them. Then the Lord God said, &ldquo;Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever&rdquo; &mdash; therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken. He drove out the man; and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.</p>

In those days, when again a great crowd&nbsp; had&nbsp; gathered,&nbsp; and they&nbsp; had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him, and said to them, &ldquo;I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with me now three days, and have nothing to eat; and if I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way; and some of them have come a long way.&rdquo; And his disciples answered him, &ldquo;How can one feed these men with bread here in the desert?&rdquo; And he asked them, &ldquo;How many loaves have you?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;Seven. &rdquo;And he commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground; and he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks he broke them &nbsp;and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and they set them before the crowd. And they had a few small fish; and having blessed them, he commanded that these also should be set before them. And they ate, and were satisfied; and they took up the broken pieces left over, seven baskets full. And there were about four thousand people. And he sent them away; and immediately he got into the boat with his disciples, and went to the district of Dalmanutha.</p>

<p><strong>THEME OF THE SUNDAY:</strong> <span style="color:#ff0000">It Was Said to Our Ancestors.</span> . . But I Say This to You. The first reading tells us that we are free and we are accountable for our actions. The second reading speaks of the wisdom of God, so different from human wisdom; the gospel gives some examples of this. The disciples do not ask Jesus to explain what he says. They believe in the love of the Father and they know that the way he shows them is the way to life.</p>

<p>FIRST READING<br />
<strong>A </strong><strong>reading </strong><strong>from </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>Book of Sirach 15: 15-20</strong><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000"><em>He has not commanded any one to be ungodly.&nbsp;&rdquo;</em></span><br />
If you will, you can keep the commandments, they will save you; if you trust in God, you too shall live. He has placed before you fire and water: stretch out your hand for whichever you wish. Before a man are life and death, good and evil, and whichever he chooses will be given to him. For great is the wisdom of the Lord; he is mighty in power and sees everything. The eyes of the Lord are on those who fear him, and he knows every deed of man. He has not commanded any one to be ungodly, and he has not given any one permission to sin.</p>

<strong>A reading from the first Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians, I Corinthians 2:6-10</strong><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000"><em>&ldquo;They </em><em>wisdom of God which he decreed before the ages for our glorification</em></span><br />
Brethren: Among the mature we do impart wisdom, although it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are doomed to pass away. But we impart a secret and hidden wisdom of God, which God decreed before the ages for our glorification. None of the rulers of this age understood this; for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. But, as it is written, What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived, what God has prepared for those who love him, God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.</p>

<strong>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew 5: 17-.37</strong><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">You <em>have </em><em>heard that it was said to the men of old, but I say to you.&rdquo;</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">*</span>At that time: Jesus said to his discip1es, &ldquo;Do not think that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them. For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. <span style="color:#ff0000">*</span>For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. &ldquo;You have heard that it was said to the men of old, &lsquo;You shall not kill; and whoever kills shall be liable to judgement. &rsquo; But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to judgement; whoever insults his brother shall be liable to the council,* and whoever says, &lsquo;You fool!&rsquo; shall be liable to the hell of fire. So if you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you,&nbsp; leave your&nbsp; gift there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. Make friends quickly with your accuser, while you are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you&nbsp; over to the judge,&nbsp; and the judge&nbsp; to the&nbsp; guard,&nbsp; and&nbsp; you&nbsp; be put in prison; truly, I say to you, you will never get out till you have paid the last &nbsp;penny. &ldquo;You have heard that it was said, &lsquo;You shall not commit adultery. &rsquo; But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.* If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away; it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away; it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell. It was also said, &lsquo;Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce. &rsquo; But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of unchastity, makes her an adulteress ; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. *&ldquo;Again you have heard that it was said to the men of old, &lsquo;You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.&rsquo; But I say to you, Do not swear at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.<span style="color:#ff0000">*</span> Let what you say be simply &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;No&rsquo;; anything more than this comes from the Evil One.&rdquo;</p>

<strong>A reading from the Book of Genesis 4:1-15.25</strong><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000"><em>&ldquo;Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and killed him.&rdquo;</em></span><br />
Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, &ldquo;I have gotten a man with the help of the Lord.&rdquo; And again, she bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a tiller of the ground. In the course of time Cain brought to the Lord an offering of the fruit of the ground, and Abel brought some of the firstlings of his flock and of their fat portions. And the Lord had regard for Abel and his offering, but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell. The Lord said to Cain, &ldquo;Why are you angry, and why has your countenance fallen? If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is lurking at the door; its desire is for you, but you must master it.&rdquo; Cain said to Abel his brother, &ldquo;Let us go out to the field.&rdquo; And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and killed him. Then the Lord said to Cain, &ldquo;Where is Abel your&nbsp; brother?&rdquo;&nbsp; He&nbsp; said, &ldquo;I do not know; am I my brother&rsquo;s keeper?&rdquo; And the Lord said, &ldquo;What have you done? The voice of your brother&rsquo;s blood is crying to me from the ground. And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother&rsquo;s blood from your hand. When you till the ground, it shall no longer yield to you its strength; you shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.&rdquo; Cain said to the Lord, &ldquo;My punishment is greater than I can bear. Behold, you have driven me this day away from the ground; and from your face I shall be hidden; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will slay me.&rdquo; Then the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Not so! If anyone slays Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.&rdquo; And the Lord put a mark on Cain, lest any who came upon him should kill him. And Adam&nbsp; knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name Seth, for she said, &ldquo;God has appointed for me another child instead of Abel, for Cain slew him.&rdquo;</p>

At that time: Jesus and the disciples came to Bethsaida. And some people brought to him a blind man, and begged him to touch him. And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the village; and when he had spit on his eyes and laid his hands upon him, he asked him, &ldquo;Do you see anything?&rdquo; And he looked up and said, &ldquo;I see men; but they look like trees, walking.&rdquo; Then again he laid his hands upon his eyes; and he looked intently and was restored, and saw everything clearly. And he sent him away to his home, saying, &ldquo;Do not even enter the village.&rdquo;</p>

<span style="color:#ff0000"><em>I set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth. &rdquo;</em></span><br />
God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, &ldquo;Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth.&nbsp; The fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every bird of the air, upon everything that creeps on the ground and all the fish of the sea; into your hand they are delivered. Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; and as I gave you the green plants, I give you everything. Only you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood. For your lifeblood I will surely require a reckoning; of every beast I will require it and of man; of every man&rsquo;s brother I will require the life of man. Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed; for God made man in his own image. And you, be fruitful and multiply, bring forth abundantly on the earth and multiply in it.&rdquo; Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him, &ldquo;Behold, I establish my covenant with you and your descendants after you, and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you, as many as came out of the ark. I establish my covenant with you, that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.&rdquo; And God said, &ldquo;This is the sign of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations: I set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth.&rdquo;</p>

<em><span style="color:#ff0000">Let us go down, and there confuse their language.</span> </em><br />
The whole earth had one language and few words. And as men migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. And they said to one another, Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.&rdquo; And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar. Then they said, &ldquo;Come, let us build our- selves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.&rdquo; And the Loan came down to see the city and the tower, which the sons of men had built. And the Loan said, &ldquo;Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is only the beginning of what they will do; and nothing that they propose to do will speech.&rdquo; So the Loan scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they left&nbsp; &nbsp;off building now be impossible for them. Come, let us go down, and the there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another&rsquo;s the city. Therefore its name was called Babel, because there Lone confused the language of all the earth; and from there the Loan scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth.</p>

At that time: Jesus called to him the multitude with his disciples, and said to them, &ldquo;If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would have his life will lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel&rsquo;s will save it. For what does it profit a man, to gain the whole world and forfeit his life? For what can a man give in return for his life? For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of man also be ashamed, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.

<p style="text-align: justify;">FIRST &nbsp;READING<br />
<strong>A reading </strong><strong>from </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>Letter </strong><strong>to </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>Hebrews </strong><strong>l </strong><strong>I </strong><strong>: </strong><strong>1-7</strong><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000"><em>By faith we understand that the world was created by the word of God. </em></span><br />
Brethren: Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. For by it the men of old received divine approval. By faith we understand that the world was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was made out of things which do not appear. By faith Abel offered to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain, through which he received approval as righteous, God bearing witness by accepting his gifts; he died, but through his faith he is still speaking. By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God had taken him. Now before he was taken he was attested as having pleased God. And without faith it is impossible to please him. For whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.&nbsp; By faith&nbsp; Noah, being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen, took heed and constructed an ark for the saving of his household; by this he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness which comes by faith.</p>

At that time: Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, and led them up a high mountain apart by themselves; and he was transfigured before them, and his garments became glistening, intensely white, as no fuller on earth could bleach them. And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses; and they were talking to Jesus. And Peter said to Jesus, &ldquo;Master, it is well that we are here; let us make three booths, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.&rdquo; For he did not know what to say, for they were exceedingly afraid. And a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud. &ldquo;This is my beloved Son; listen to him.&rdquo; And suddenly looking around they no longer saw any one with them but Jesus only. And as they were coming down the mountain, he charged them to tell no one what they had seen, until the Son of man should have&nbsp; risen&nbsp; from the&nbsp; dead.&nbsp; So they&nbsp; kept the&nbsp; matter to themselves, questioning what the rising from the dead meant. And they asked him, &ldquo;Why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come?&rdquo; And he said to them, &ldquo;Elijah does come first to restore&nbsp; all things; and how is it written of the Son of man, that he should suffer many things and be treated with contempt? But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they pleased, as it is written of him.&rdquo;</p>

<em>Today&#39;s Rosary: Glorious Mystery</em><br />
<strong>Vespers II of Sunday</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>THEME OF THE SUNDAY:</strong> <span style="color:#ff0000">Be as Your Father! </span>It is important to link the gospel of today with the first reading which speaks of the need to be holy because God is holy. The book of Leviticus specifies the &ldquo;holiness&rdquo; that the Lord demands: not a show of religiosity, but love for one another. The gospel tells us that holiness consists in being like the Father . . . with all the practical consequences that flow from our being his children. The second reading replies to the objection, &ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t what Jesus proposes sheer madness?&rdquo; Yes, it is foolishness for humans, but it is &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; for God.</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify;">FIRST READING&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<strong>A reading&nbsp; from the Book of Leviticus 19: 1-2.I 7&mdash;18</strong><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000"><em>&ldquo;You shall love your neighbour as yourself. &rdquo;</em></span><br />
The Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Say to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, You shall be holy; for I the Lord your God am holy. &ldquo;You shall not hate your brother in your heart, but you shall reason with your neighbour, lest you bear sin because of him. You shall not take vengeance or bear any grudge against the sons of your own people, but you shall love your neighbour as yourself: I am the Lord.<br />
The word of the Lord.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">RESPONSORIAL PSALM Psalm 1 U3 : I -2.3-4.8. 1 0.12- 13 (R. 8a)</span><br />
<strong>R.&nbsp;The Lord is&nbsp; compassionate&nbsp; and gracious.</strong></p>

<p>Bless the LORD, O my soul,<br />
and all within me, his holy name.<br />
Bless the Lord, O my soul,<br />
and never forget all his benefits. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p>It is the Lord who forgives all your sins,<br />
who heals every one of your ills,<br />
who redeems your life from the grave,<br />
who crowns you with mercy and compassion. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p>The Lord is compassionate and gracious,<br />
slow to anger and rich in mercy.<br />
He does not treat us according to our sins,<br />
nor repay us according to our faults. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p>As far as the east is from the west,<br />
so far from us does he remove our transgressions.<br />
As a father has compassion on his children,<br />
the Lords compassion is on those who fear him. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">SECOND READING<br />
<strong>A reading from the first Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians, I Corinthians 3 :16-2</strong><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000"><em>&ldquo;All </em><em>things </em><em>are </em><em>yours, </em><em>and </em><em>you </em><em>are Christ&rsquo;s,&rsquo; and Christ is God&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</em></span><br />
Brethren: Do you not know that you are God&rsquo;s temple and that God&rsquo;s Spirit dwells in you? If anyone destroys God&rsquo;s temple, God will destroy him. For God&rsquo;s temple is holy, and that temple you are. Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise. For the wisdom of this world is folly with God. For it is written, &ldquo;He catches the wise in their craftiness,&rdquo; and again, &ldquo;The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.&rdquo; So let no one boast of men. For all things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future, all are yours; and you are Christ and Christ is God&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The word of the Lord.</p>

<span style="color:#ff0000"><em>&ldquo;Love </em><em>your </em><em>enemies. </em><em>&rdquo;</em></span><br />
At that time: Jesus said to his disciples, &ldquo;You have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. But I say to you, Do not resist one who is evil. But if any one strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also; and if anyone would sue you and take your coat, let him have your cloak as well; and&nbsp; if any one forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. Give to him who begs from you, and do not refuse him who would borrow from you. &ldquo;You have heard that it was said, &lsquo;You shall love your neighbour and hate your enemy. &rsquo; But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you salute only your brethren, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.&rdquo;</p>

All wisdom comes from the Lord and is with him forever. The sand of the sea, the drops of rain, and the days of eternity &mdash; who can count them? The height of heaven, the breadth of the earth, the abyss, and wisdom who can search them out? Wisdom was created before all things, and prudent understanding from eternity. The source of wisdom is God&rsquo;s word in the highest heaven, and her ways are the eternal commandments.&nbsp; The root of wisdom to whom has it been revealed? Her clever devices who knows them? The knowledge of wisdom &mdash; to whom was it manifested? And her abundant experience who has understood it? There is one who is wise, the Creator of all, the King greatly to be feared, sitting upon his throne, and ruling as God. The Lord himself created wisdom in the holy spirit; he saw her and apportioned her, he poured her out upon all his works. She dwells with all flesh according to his gift, and he supplied her to those who love him.</p>

And immediately all the crowd, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and ran up to him and greeted him. And he asked them, &ldquo;What are you discussing with them?&rdquo; And one of the crowd answered him, &ldquo;Teacher, I brought my son to you, for he has a mute spirit; and wherever it seizes him, it dashes him down; and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid; and&nbsp; I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they were not able.&rdquo; And he answered them, &ldquo;O faithless generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him to me.&rdquo; And they brought the boy to him; and when the spirit saw him, immediately it convulsed the boy, and he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth. And Jesus asked his father, &ldquo;How long has he had this?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;From childhood. And it has often cast him into the fire and into the water, to destroy him; but if you can do anything, have pity on us and help us.&rdquo; And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;If you can! All things are possible to him who believes.&rdquo; Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, &ldquo;I believe; help my unbelief!&rdquo; And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, &ldquo;You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never enter him again.&rdquo; And after crying out and convulsing him terribly, it came out, and the boy was like a corpse; so that most of them said, &ldquo;He is dead.&rdquo; But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose. And when he had entered the house, his disciples asked him privately, &ldquo;Why could we not cast it out?&rdquo; And he said to them, &ldquo;This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer and fasting.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">FIRST READING<br />
<strong>A </strong><strong>reading&nbsp; </strong><strong>from </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>Book </strong><strong>of </strong><strong>Sirach </strong>2 : l - 11<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000"><em>Prepare yourself for temptation.&rdquo;</em></span><br />
My son, if you come forward to serve the Lord, remain in justice and in fear, and prepare yourself for temptation. Set your heart right and be steadfast, incline your ear, and receive words of understanding, and do not be hasty in time of calamity. Await God&rsquo;s patience, cling to him and do not depart, that you may be wise in all your ways. Accept whatever is brought upon you, and endure it in sorrow; in changes that humble you be patient. For gold and silver are tested in the fire, and acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation. Trust in God, and he will help you; hope in him, and he will make your ways straight.&nbsp; Stay in fear of him, and grow old in him. You who fear the Lord, wait for his mercy; and turn not aside, lest you fall. You who fear the Lord, trust in him, and. your reward will not fail; you who fear the Lord, hope for good things, for everlasting joy and mercy. You who fear the Lord, love him, and your hearts will be made radiant. Consider the ancient generations and see: who ever trusted in the Lord and was put to shame? Or whoever persevered in his commandments and was forsaken? Or whoever called upon him and was overlooked? For the Lord is compassionate and merciful; he forgives sins and saves in time of affliction, and he is the shield of all who seek him in truth.</p>

At that time: Jesus and his disciples went on from the mountain and passed through Galilee. And he would not have any one know it; for he was teaching his disciples, saying to them, &ldquo;The Son of man will be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is killed, after three days he will rise.&rdquo; But they did not understand the saying, and they were afraid to ask him. And they came to Capernaum; and when he was in the house he asked them, &ldquo;What were you discussing on the way? But they were silent; for on the way they had discussed with one another who was the greatest. And he sat down and called the Twelve; and he said to them, If anyone would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all. And he took a child, and put him in the midst of them; and taking him in his arms, he said to them, Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me; and whoever receives me, receives not me but him who sent me.</p>

<span style="color:#ff0000"><em>A </em><em>faithful friend is beyond comparison.</em></span><br />
A pleasant voice multiplies friends and softens enemies, and a gracious tongue multiplies courtesies. Let those that are at peace with you be many, but let your advisers be one in a thousand. When you gain a friend, gain him through testing, and do not trust him hastily. For there is a friend who&nbsp; is such at his own convenience,&nbsp; but will not stand by you in your day of trouble. And there is a friend who changes into an enemy, and will disclose a quarrel to your disgrace. And there is a friend who is a table companion, but will not stand by you in your day of trouble. In your prosperity&nbsp; he will make himself your equal, and be bold with your servants; but if you are brought low he will turn against you, and will hide himself from your presence. Keep yourself far from your enemies, and be on guard towards your friends. A faithful friend is a sturdy shelter: he that has found one has found a treasure. There is nothing so precious as a faithful friend, and no scales can measure his excellence. A faithful friend is an elixir of life; and those who fear the Lord will find him. Whoever fears the Lord directs his friendship aright, for as he is, so is his neighbour also.</p>

But from the beginning of creation, &lsquo;God made them male and female. For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. &rsquo; So they are no longer two but one flesh.

He placed the fear of him into their hearts,&nbsp; showing them&nbsp; the majesty&nbsp; of his works.&nbsp; He made them glory in his wondrous deeds, that they might praise his holy name, to proclaim the grandeur of his works.

<strong>THEME OF THE SUNDAY</strong>: <span style="color:#ff0000">God Is Father and Mother.</span> The first reading and the gospel complement each other. In the first reading God is compared to a mother, while in the gospel he is compared to a father who provides all that his children need. Can we be so foolish as to abandon God who is so good, to worship idols? Can money give us more comfort? At what cost? The second reading is also linked to this theme, because it tells us that Paul is not worried about what people say or think of him. He places all his trust in God.</p>

Brethren: This is how one should regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God. Moreover it is required of stewards that they be found trustworthy.

At that time: Jesus said to his disciples, &ldquo;No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mamnion. &ldquo;Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you shall eat or what you shall drink, nor about your body, what you shall put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his span of life? And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not&nbsp; clothed like one of these.&nbsp; But&nbsp; if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? Therefore do not be anxious, saying, &lsquo;What shall we eat?&rsquo; or &lsquo;What shall we drink? &rsquo; or &lsquo;What shall we wear?&rsquo; For the Gentiles seek all these things; and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But seek first his&nbsp; &nbsp;kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be yours as well. Therefore, do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Let the day&rsquo;s own trouble be sufficient for the day.</p>

Turn to the Lord and forsake your sins; pray in his presence and lessen your offences. Return to the Most High and turn away from iniquity, and hate abominations intensely. Know the justice and the judgements of God, and stand firm&nbsp; the&nbsp; lot that is set before you, in prayer to God, the Almighty. Who will sing praises to the Most High in Hades, as do those who are alive and give thanks? Tarry not in the waywardness of the ungodly, and give thanks before death. From the dead, as from one who does not exist, thanksgiving has ceased; he who is alive and well sings the LORD praises. How great is the mercy of the Lord, and his forgiveness for those who turn to him!</p>

<strong>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark 10:17-27</strong><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000"><em>Go, sell what you have, and follow me.</em></span><br />
At that time: As Jesus was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him, and asked him, &ldquo;Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life? And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. You know the commandments: &lsquo;Do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not defraud, honour your father and mother. &rdquo;&rsquo; And he said to him, &ldquo;Teacher, all these I have observed from my youth.&rdquo; And Jesus looking upon him loved him, and said to him, &ldquo;You lack one thing; go, sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.&rdquo; At that saying his countenance fell, and he went away sorrowful; for he had great possessions. And Jesus looked around and said&nbsp; to his disciples,&nbsp; &ldquo;How hard it will be for those who have riches&nbsp; to enter the kingdom of God!&rdquo; And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them&nbsp; again, &ldquo;Children, how hard it&nbsp; is for those who trust in riches to enter the kingdom of God! It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.&rdquo; And they were exceedingly astonished, and said to him, &ldquo;Then who can be saved?&rdquo; Jesus looked at them and said, &ldquo;With men it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">FIRST READING<br />
<strong>A reading from the Book of Sirach 35: 1-12</strong><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000"><em>He </em><em>who </em><em>heeds the </em><em>commandments sacrifices a peace offering.</em></span><br />
He who keeps the law makes many offerings; he who heeds the commandments sacrifices a peace offering. He who returns a kind- ness offers fine flour, and he who gives alms sacrifices a thank offering. To keep from wickedness is pleasing to the Loco, and to forsake unrighteousness is atonement. Do not appear before the Loco empty-handed, for all these things are to be done because&nbsp; of the commandment. The offering of a righteous man anoints the altar, and its pleasing odour rises before the Most High. The sacrifice of a righteous man is&nbsp; acceptable,&nbsp; and the memory&nbsp; of it will not be forgotten. Glorify the Loan generously, and do not stint the first fruits of your hands. With every gift show a cheerful face, and dedicate your tithe with gladness. Give to the Most High as he has given and as generously as your hand has found. For the Loco is the one who repays, and he will repay you sevenfold. Do not offer him a bribe, for he will not accept it; and do not trust to an unrighteous sacrifice; for the Lord is the judge, and with him is no partiality.</p>

<p>Gather my holy ones to me,<br />
who made covenant with me by sacrifice.<br />
The heavens proclaim his justice,<br />
for he, God, is the judge. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

Ash Wednesday (Fast and Abstinence)<br />
Office- Psalter Week 4 and Ordinary for Lent<br />
Vestment: Violent<br />
Today&rsquo;s Rosary: The Sorrowful Mystery</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">THE SEASON OF LENT </span>is a time for the preparation for the celebration of Easter. The liturgy prepares the catechumens for the celebration of the Paschal mystery by the various stages of Christian initiation; it also prepares the faithful, who recall their baptism and do penance in preparation for Easter.<br />
The beginning of Lent is marked with the blessing and imposition of ashes on <span style="color:#ff0000">Ash Wednesday</span> or, for pastoral reasons, on the <span style="color:#ff0000">First Sunday of Lent</span>. The act of putting on ashes symbolises our fragility and mortality as well as our need to be redeemed by the mercy of God.<br />
1. Ash Wednesday is not a holy day of obligation<br />
2. Masses for the Dead, except funeral Masses are forbidden <span style="color:#ff0000"><em>(GIRM n, 380/381)</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">*</span>In Masses of the season the Gloria is omitted.<span style="color:#ff0000"> *</span>The alter is not decorated with flowers during Lent. Musical Instruments are not used except on Laetare Sunday and for Solemnities and feasts or to sustain singing.<span style="color:#ff0000"> *</span>Alleluia and Gloria is omitted in all Masses and in the Divine Office <span style="color:#ff0000">*</span>Ashes are blessed and distributed at the principal Mass.<br />
In the course of today&#39;s Mass, ashes are blessed and distributed. These are made from the olive branches or branches of other trees that were blessed the previous year.<br />
During Lent, one of the following acclamation is used instead of Alleluia as a response to the verse before the Gospel:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
	<li><strong>Glory and praise to you, O Christ.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Glory to you, O Christ, Wisdom of God the Father.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Glory to you, O Christ, Word of God.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Glory to you, O Christ, Son of the living God.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Praise and honour to you, Lord Jesus.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Praise to you, O Christ, king of eternal glory.</strong></li>

Tear your hearts and not your garments.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of the Prophet Joel 2 : 12-18</span><br />
Even now,&rdquo; says the Lord, &ldquo;return to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning; and tear your hearts and not your garments.&rdquo; Return to the Lord, your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in mercy, and repents of evil. Who knows whether he will not turn and repent, and leave a blessing behind him, a cereal offering and a drink offering for the Lord, your God? Blow the trumpet in Zion; sanctify a fast; call a solemn assembly; gather the people. Sanctify&nbsp;the congregation; assemble the elders; gather the children, even nursing infants. Let the bridegroom leave his room, and the bride her chamber. Between the vestibule&nbsp; and the altar let the priests, the ministers of the Lord, weep and say, &ldquo;Spare your people, O Lord, and make not your heritage a reproach, a byword among the nations. Why should they say among the peoples, &lsquo;Where is their God?&rdquo;&rsquo; Then the Lord became jealous for his land, and had pity on his people.</p>

<p>The word of the Lord.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the second Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians, (2 Corinthians 5:20&mdash;6:2)</span><br />
Brethren: We are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. Working together with him, then, we entreat you not to accept the grace of God in vain. For he says, &ldquo;At the acceptable time I have listened to you, and helped you on the day of salvation.&rdquo; Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">&ldquo;A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew (Matthew 6: 1-6.16- 18)</span><br />
At that time: Jesus said to his disciples, &ldquo;Beware of practicing your piety before men in order to be seen by them; for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. &ldquo;Thus, when you give alms, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by men. Truly, I say to you, they have their reward. But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your alms may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you. &ldquo;And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the&nbsp;synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by men. Truly, I say to you, they have their reward. But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you. &ldquo;And when you fast, do not look dismal, like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by men.Truly, I say to you, they have their reward. But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, that your fasting may not be&nbsp;seen by men but&nbsp;by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.&rdquo;</p>

Moses spoke to the people, saying, See, I have set before you this day life and good, death and evil.

But if your heart tums away, and you will not hear, but are drawn away to worship other gods and serve them, I&nbsp;declare&nbsp; to you&nbsp; this&nbsp;day, that you shall perish; you shall not live long in the land which you are going over the Jordan to enter and possess. I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before your life and death, blessing and curse; therefore choose life, that you and your descendants may live, loving the Lord your God, obeying his voice, and clinging to him; for that means life to you and length of days, that you may dwell in the land which the Lord swore to your fathers, to Abraham,&nbsp;to Isaac,&nbsp;and to Jacob, to give them.</p>

<strong>Vespers II of&nbsp; the First Sunday of Lent</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Theme of the Sunday:</strong> <span style="color:#ff0000">Temptation. </span>In this time of Lent, the Church invites us to reflect on temptation. The first reading tells us of the unfaithful man, the man who lets himself be seduced by evil and chooses to go against the will of God. This man destroys himself and condemns himself to unhappiness. The second reading describes the behaviour of Jesus, the obedient son of his Father. The Gospel describes the temptations that Jesus faced in his mission of salvation. Our own temptations are not very different.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">FIRST READING<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000"><em>Creation of our first parents, and their sin.</em></span><br />
<strong>A reading from the Book of Genesis 2:7-9; 3 : 1-7</strong><br />
The Lord God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. And the Lord God planted a garden in Eden, in the east; and there he put the man whom he had formed. And out of the ground the Lord God &nbsp;made to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Now the serpent was more subtle than any other wild creature that the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, &ldquo;Did God say, &lsquo;You shall not eat of any tree of the garden&rsquo;?&rdquo; And the woman said to the serpent, &ldquo;We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden; but God said, &lsquo;You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die. &rdquo;&rsquo; But the serpent said to the woman, &ldquo;You will not die. For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.&rdquo; So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate; and she also gave some to her husband, and he ate. Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons.</p>

<span style="color:#ff0000"><em>Where </em><em>sin </em><em>has </em><em>abounded, </em><em>grace </em><em>has </em><em>abounded </em><em>all the more.&rdquo;</em></span><br />
<strong>A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Romans 5:12- 19</strong><br />
Brethren: As sin came into the world through one man and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all men sinned&mdash; sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted where there is no law. Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sins were not like the transgression of Adam, who was a type of the one who was to come. But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if many died through&nbsp;one man&rsquo;s trespass, much more have the grace of God and the free gift&nbsp; in the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for many. And the free gift is not like the effect of that one man&rsquo;s sin. For the judgement following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brings justification. If, because of one man&rsquo;s trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ. Then as one man&rsquo;s trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one man&rsquo;s act of righteousness leads to acquittal and life for all men. For as by one man&rsquo;s disobedience many were made sinners, so by one man&rsquo;s obedience many will be made righteous.</p>

Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked, says the Lord God, and not rather that he should turn from his way and live? But when a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity and does the same abominable things that the wicked man does, shall he live? None of the righteous deeds which he has done shall be remembered; for the treachery of which he is guilty and the sin he has committed, he shall die. Yet you say, &lsquo;The way of the Lord is not just. &rsquo; Hear now, O house of Israel: Is my way not just? Is it not your ways that are not just? When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity, he shall die for it; for the iniquity which he has committed he shall die. Again, when a wicked man turns away from the wickedness he has committed and does what is lawful and right, he shall save his life. Because he considered and turned away from all the transgressions which he had committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.&rdquo;</p>

At that time: Jesus said to his disciples, &ldquo;Unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of &nbsp;heaven. You have heard that it was said to the men of old, &lsquo;You shall not kill; and whoever kills shall be liable to judgement. &rsquo; But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to judgement; whoever insults his brother shall be liable to the council, and whoever says, &lsquo;You fool ! &rsquo; shall be liable to the hell of fire. So if you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go; first be&nbsp; &nbsp;reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. Make friends quickly with your accuser, while you are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison; truly I say to you, you will never get out till you have paid the last penny.&rdquo;</p>

Moses spoke to the people, saying: This day the Lord your God commands you to do these statutes and ordinances; you shall therefore be careful to do them with all your heart and with all your soul. You have declared this day concerning the Lord that he is your God, and that you will walk in his ways, and keep his statutes and his commandments and his ordinances, and will obey his voice; and the Lord &nbsp;has declared this day concerning you that you are a people for his own possession, as he has promised you, and that you are to keep all his commandments, that he will set you high above all nations that he has made, in praise and in fame and in honour, and that you shall be a people holy to the Lord your God, as he has spoken.&rdquo;</p>

<strong>Vespers II of the Second Sunday of Lent</strong><br />
<strong>Theme of the Sunday:</strong> <span style="color:#ff0000">The Vocation of Abraham and the Vocation of the Christian.</span> The life of a Christian can be compared to a journey undertaken in the company of the Master. Abraham was the first to set off on this journey in answer to a call from God (first reading). Like him every catechumen is invited to leave his &ldquo;country.&rdquo; The Gospel shows us the only light that the catechumen should follow. The second reading calls upon the disciples not to be discouraged when they meet difficulties.</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify">FIRST READING Genesis 12: 1-4a<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000"><em>The </em><em>call </em><em>of Abraham, the father of the People of God.</em></span><br />
<strong>A reading from the Book of Genesis</strong><br />
In those days: The Lord said to Abram, &ldquo;Go from your country and your kindred and your father&rsquo;s house to the land that I will show you. And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and him who curses you I will curse; and by you all the families of the earth shall bless themselves.&rdquo; So Abram went, as the LORD had told him.</p>

And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his garments became white as light. And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him. And Peter said to Jesus, &ldquo;Lord, it is well that we are here; if you wish, I will make three booths here, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.&rdquo; He was still speaking, when behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, &ldquo;This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.&rdquo; When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces, and were filled with awe. But Jesus came and touched them, saying, &ldquo;Rise, and have no fear.&rdquo; And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only. And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, &ldquo;Tell no one the vision, until the Son of man is raised from the dead.&rdquo;</p>

O Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and merciful love with those who love him and keep his commandments, we have sinned and done wrong and acted wickedly and rebelled, turning aside from your commandments and ordinances; we have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land. To you, O Lord, belongs&nbsp; righteousness,&nbsp; but to us confusion of face, as at this day, to the men of Judah, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, those that are near and those that are far away, in all the lands to which you have driven them, because of the treachery which they have committed against you. To us, O Lord, belongs confusion of &nbsp;face, to our &nbsp;kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against you.

They do all their deeds to be seen by men; for they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long, and they love the place of &nbsp;honour at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues, and salutations in the market places, and being called rabbi by men. But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brethren. And call no man your father on earth, for you &nbsp;have one Father, who is in heaven.

A <strong>reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke </strong>1 6: I 9-31<br />
At that time: Jesus said to the Pharisees, &ldquo;There was a rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day. And at his gate lay a poor man named Lazarus, full of sores, who desired to be fed with what&nbsp; fell from the rich man&rsquo;s table; moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham&rsquo;s bosom. The rich man also died and was buried; and in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes, and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus in his bosom. And he called out, &lsquo;Father Abraham, have mercy upon me, and send Lazarus to dip the end of &nbsp;his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame.&#39; &ldquo;But Abraham said, &lsquo;Son, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish. And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able, and none may cross from there to us. &rsquo; And he said, &#39;Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father&rsquo;s house, for I have five brothers, so that he may warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment. &rsquo; But Abraham said, &lsquo;They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.&rsquo; And he said &lsquo;No, father Abraham; but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent. &rsquo; He said to him, &lsquo;If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

But at your word I will let down the nets.&rdquo; And when they had done&nbsp; this,&nbsp; they&nbsp; enclosed&nbsp; a great shoal of fish; and as their nets were breaking, they beckoned to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus&rsquo; knees, saying, &ldquo;Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.&rdquo; For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the catch of fish which they had taken; and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.

Shepherd your people, [O Lord,] with your staff, the flock of your inheritance, who dwell alone in a forest in the midst of a garden land; let them feed in Bashan and Gilead as in the days of old.

At that time: The tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to hear Jesus. And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, This man receives sinners and eats with them. So he told them this parable: There was a man who had two sons; and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the share of property that falls to me. And he divided his living between them. Not many days later, the younger son gathered all he had and took his journey into a far country, and there he squandered his property in loose living. And when he had spent everything, a great famine arose in that country, and he began to be in want. So he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he would gladly have fed on the pods that swine ate; and no one gave him anything. But when he came to himself he said, How many of my father&#39;s hired servants have bread enough and to spare, but I perish here with hunger! I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me as one of your hired servants. And he arose and came to his father. But while he was yet at a distance, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him. And the son said to him, &lsquo;Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son. &rsquo; But the father said to his servants, &lsquo;Bring quickly the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet; and bring the fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and make merry; for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. &rsquo; And they began to make merry. &ldquo;Now his elder son was in the field; and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing. And he called one of the servants&nbsp; and asked what this meant. And he said to him, &lsquo;Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has received him safe and sound.&rsquo; But he was angry and refused to go in. His father came out and entreated him, but he answered his father, &lsquo;Behold, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command; yet you never gave me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends. But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your living with harlots, you killed for him the fatted calf! &rsquo;And he said to him, &lsquo;Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours. It was fitting to make merry and be glad, for this your brother was dead, and is alive; he was lost, and is found.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Theme of the Sunday:</strong><span style="color:#ff0000"> If You Knew the Gift of God.</span> We have all experienced thirst; we all know what happens to our fields when it doesn&rsquo;t rain. The first reading and the Gospel speak to us of water. In the desert the people of Israel survived because God provided water for them. In the Gospel Jesus speaks of a new water, a new life that he wants to give us. The second reading shows why we should trust and be joyful because no one will be deprived of this water.</p>

In those days: The people thirsted for water, and the people murmured against Moses, and said, &ldquo;Why did you bring us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?&rdquo; So Moses cried to the Lord, &ldquo;What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me.&rdquo; And the Lord said to Moses, Pass on before the people, taking with you some of the elders of Israel; and take in your hand the rod with which you struck the Nile, and go. Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and water shall come out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so, in the sight of the elders of Israel. And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah, because of the fault-finding of the children of Israel, and because they put the Lord to the test by saying, &ldquo;Is the Lord among us or not?&rdquo;</p>

<em>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.&rdquo;</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Romans 5:1-2.5-8</span><br />
Brethren: Since we are justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through him we have obtained access to this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in our hope of sharing the glory of God. And hope does not disappoint us, because God&rsquo;s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us. While we were yet helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. Why, one will hardly die for a righteous man &mdash; though perhaps for a good man one will dare even to die. But God shows his love for us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us.</p>

<span style="color:#ff0000">* A reading from the holy Gospel according t<strong>o&nbsp;John (John 4: 5-42)</strong></span><br />
<strong><span style="color:#ff0000">*</span></strong> At that time: Jesus came to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. Jacob&rsquo;s well was there, and so Jesus, wearied as he was with his journey, sat down beside the well. It was about the sixth hour. There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Give me a drink.&rdquo; For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food. The Samaritan woman said to him, &ldquo;How is it that you, a Jew, ask a drink of me, a woman of Samaria?&rdquo; For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans. Jesus answered her, &ldquo;If you knew the gift of God, and who&nbsp; it is that is saying to you, &lsquo;Give me a drink, &rsquo; you would have asked him and he would have&nbsp; given you &nbsp;living water.&rdquo;&nbsp; The woman&nbsp; said to him, &ldquo;Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep; where do you get that living water? Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, and his&nbsp; sons, and his cattle?&rdquo; Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Every one who drinks of this water will thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst; the water that I shall give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.&rdquo; The woman said to him, &ldquo;Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst,&nbsp; nor come here to draw.&rdquo; <strong><span style="color:#ff0000">*</span></strong><br />
Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Go, call your husband, and come here.&rdquo; The woman answered him, &ldquo;I have no husband.&rdquo; Jesus said to her, &ldquo;You are right in saying, &lsquo;I have no&nbsp; husband&rsquo;;&nbsp; for you&nbsp; have&nbsp; had five husbands, and he whom you now have is not your husband; this you said truly.&rdquo;<br />
The woman said to him, &quot; &ldquo;Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet. Our fathers worshipped on this mountain; and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.&rdquo; Jesus said&nbsp; to her, &ldquo;Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on&nbsp; this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour is coming, and now is, when&nbsp; the&nbsp; true&nbsp; worshippers&nbsp; will&nbsp; worship&nbsp; the&nbsp; Father&nbsp; in&nbsp; spirit and truth, for such the Father seeks to worship him. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.&rdquo; The woman said to him, &ldquo;I know that Messiah is coming (he who is called Christ); when he comes, he will show us all things.&rdquo; Jesus said to her, &ldquo;I who speak to you am he.&rdquo; <span style="color:#ff0000">*</span><br />
Just then his disciples came. They marvelled that he was talking with a woman, but none said, &ldquo;What do you wish?&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Why are you talking with her?&rdquo; So the woman left her water jar, and went away into the city, and said to the people, &ldquo;Come, see a man who told me all that I ever did. Can this be the Christ?&rdquo; They went&nbsp; out of the city and were coming to him. Meanwhile the disciples begged him, saying, &ldquo;Rabbi, eat.&rdquo; But he said to them, &ldquo;I have food to eat of which you do not know.&rdquo; So the disciples said to one another, &ldquo;Has any one brought him food?&rdquo; Jesus said to them, &ldquo;My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work. Do you not say, &lsquo;There are yet four months, then comes the harvest&rsquo;? I tell you, lift up your eyes, and see how the fields are already white for harvest. He who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together. For here the saying holds true, &lsquo;One sows and another reaps.&rsquo; I sent you to reap that for which you did not labour; others have laboured, and you have entered into their labour.&rdquo;<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000"><strong>* </strong></span>Many Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the woman&rsquo;s testimony, &ldquo;He told me all that I ever did.&rdquo; So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them; and he stayed there two days. And many more believed because of his word, They said to the woman, &ldquo;It is no longer because of your words that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.&rdquo;</p>

Brethren: The promise to Abraham and his descendants, that they should inherit the world, did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith. That is why all depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his descendants &mdash; not only to the adherents of the law but also to those who share the faith of Abraham, for he is the father of us all, as it is written, &ldquo;I have made you the father of many nations&rdquo; &mdash; in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist. In hope he believed against hope, that he should become the father of many nations; as he had been told, &ldquo;So shall your descendants be.&rdquo; That is why his faith was &ldquo;reckoned to him as righteousness.</p>

<em>&ldquo;Joseph did as the angel of the Lord commanded him.&rdquo;</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew&nbsp;I:16.18&mdash;21.24a</span><br />
Jacob was the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ. Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit; and her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to send her away quietly. But as he considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, &ldquo;Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit; she will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.&rdquo; When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him.</p>

<strong>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke&nbsp;2:41-51a</strong><br />
The parents of Jesus went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the Passover. And when he was twelve years old, they went up according to custom; and when the feast was ended, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it, but supposing him to&nbsp; be&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; company&nbsp; they went a day&rsquo;s journey, and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintances; and when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking him. After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions; and all who heard him were amazed at his under- standing and his answers. And when they saw him they were astonished; and his mother said to him,&nbsp; &ldquo;Son,&nbsp; why have&nbsp; you&nbsp; treated us so? Behold,. your father and I have been looking for you anxiously.&rdquo; And he said to them, &ldquo;How is it that you sought me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father&rsquo;s house?&rdquo; And they did not understand the saying which he spoke to them. And he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them.</p>

<em>&ldquo;With a contrite heart and a humble spirit may we be accepted &rdquo;</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of the Prophet Daniel 3:2.11-20</span><br />
In those days: Azariah stood and offered this prayer; in the midst of the fire he opened his mouth and said: &ldquo;For your name&rsquo;s sake do not give us up utterly, and do not break your covenant, and do not withdraw your mercy from us, for the sake of Abraham your beloved and for the sake of Isaac your servant and Israel your holy one, to whom you promised to make their descendants as many as the stars of heaven and as the sand on the shore of the sea. For we, O Lord, have become fewer than any nation, and are brought low this day in all the world because of our sins. And at this time there is no prince, or prophet, or leader, no burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, no place to make an offering before you or to find mercy. Yet with a contrite heart and a humble spirit may we be accepted, as though it were with burnt offerings of rams and bulls, and with tens of thousands of fat lambs; such may our sacrifice be&nbsp; in your sight this day, and may we wholly follow you, for there will be no shame for those who trust in you. And now with all our heart we follow you, we fear you and seek your face. Do not put us to shame, but deal with us in your forbearance and in your abundant mercy. Deliver us in accordance with your marvellous works, and give glory to your name, O Lord!&rdquo;</p>

<em>If you do not forgive your brother from your heart, the Father will not forgive you,</em><br />

At that time: Peter came up and said to Jesus, &ldquo;Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven. &ldquo;Therefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants. When he began the reckoning, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents; and as he could not pay, his lord ordered him to be sold, with his wife and children and all&nbsp; that he had, and payment to be made. So the servant fell on his knees, imploring him, &lsquo;Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay you everything. &rsquo; &ldquo;And out of pity for him the lord of that servant released him and forgave him the debt. But that same servant, as he went out, came upon one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii; and seizing him by the throat he said, &lsquo;Pay what you owe.&rsquo; So his fellow servant fell down and pleaded with him, &lsquo;Have patience with me, and I will pay you. &rsquo;&ldquo;He refused and went and put him in prison till he should pay the debt. When his fellow servants saw what had taken place, they were greatly distressed, and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place. Then&nbsp;his&nbsp;lord summoned&nbsp;him&nbsp;and&nbsp;said&nbsp;to&nbsp;him,&nbsp;&lsquo;You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me; and should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you? And in anger his lord delivered him to the jailers, till he should pay all his debt. So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.&rdquo;</p>

From the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt to this day, I have &nbsp;persistently sent all my servants the prophets to them, day&nbsp; after day; yet&nbsp; they&nbsp; did not listen to me, or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck.

At that time: Jesus was casting out a demon that was mute; when&nbsp; the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke, and the people marvelled. But some of them said, &ldquo;He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of demons&rdquo;; while others, to test him, sought from him a sign from heaven.&nbsp; But he,&nbsp; knowing&nbsp; their&nbsp; thoughts,&nbsp;said to them, &ldquo;Every kingdom divided against itself&nbsp; is laid waste,&nbsp; and house falls upon house. And if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul. And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges. But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, his goods are&nbsp;in peace;&nbsp;but when one stronger than he assails him and&nbsp; overcomes&nbsp; him,&nbsp; he&nbsp; takes away his armour in which he trusted,&nbsp; and&nbsp; divides his&nbsp; spoil.

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Feast</span>: <strong>The Virgin Will Give Birth to a Son.</strong> The God of Israel is always ready to work wonders, on condition that we place all our trust in him. The first reading presents us with the young Ahaz, king of Israel, who must make an embarrassing choice: to act according to human logic in politics and diplomacy or to trust the promises of God. The gospel presents us with one of his wonderful works: what he did for Mary, the virgin, who, unlike Ahaz, placed her full trust in him, and put her &ldquo;nothingness&rdquo; at his disposal. She became his masterpiece. All are called to experience the powerful love of God. The second reading tells us how: not through the offering of holocausts and sacrifices, but by &ldquo;doing the will of the Lord&rdquo; as Jesus and Mary did.</p>

Is it too little for you to weary men, that you weary my God also? Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign.

<strong>A reading from the Letter to the Hebrews 10:4-10</strong><br />
Brethren: It is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins. Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said, &ldquo;Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired, but a body you have prepared for me; in burnt offerings and sin offerings you have taken no pleasure. Then I said, &lsquo;Behold, I have come to do your will, O God,&rsquo; as it is written of me in the roll of the book.&rdquo; When he said above &ldquo;You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings&rdquo; (these are offered according to the law), then he added, &ldquo;Behold, I have come to do your will.&rdquo; He abolishes the first in order to establish the second. And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</p>

And the angel said to her, &ldquo;Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign&nbsp; over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there will be no end.&rdquo; And Mary said to the angel, &ldquo;How will this be, since I know not man?&rdquo; And the angel said to her, &ldquo;The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God. And behold, your kinswoman Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.

<span style="color:#ff0000">The Forth Sunday</span> of Lent is traditionally known as <strong>&ldquo;Laetare Sunday&rdquo;</strong> it is so called from the first word of the antiphon at the introit (Entrance Antiphon),&nbsp; &ldquo;Latare&rdquo; (Rejoice) taken from the Latin translation of Isaiah 66:10-11, Set a tone of joyful anticipation of the <em>Easter</em> Mystery as does the permitted use of rose-colored vestment.<br />
<strong>Vesper II of Fourth Sunday of Lent</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Sunday:</span> <strong>The Christian:</strong> A Person&nbsp;Who&nbsp;&ldquo;Has&nbsp;Received&nbsp;the Light.&rdquo; The Christians of the first centuries used to call those who received Baptism during the Easter Vigil the &ldquo;enlightened.&rdquo; The theme of light is found in the three readings of today. The first reading tells us that whoever has not received the light judges things through human eyes; in reality he cannot see at all. The Gospel tells us how to reach the light. The second reading completes this theme by telling us what we should do to defeat darkness.</p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING</strong><br />
<em>David is </em><em>anointed </em><em>king of Israel.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the first Book of Samuel: 1 Samuel 16:I b.6-7.1 0- I 3a</span><br />
In those days: The Lord&nbsp;said to Samuel, &ldquo;Fill your horn with oil, and go; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided for myself a king among his sons.&rdquo; When they came, he looked on Eliab and thought, &ldquo;Surely the Lord&rsquo;s anointed is before him.&rdquo; But the Lord &nbsp;said to Samuel, &ldquo;Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for the Lord sees not as man sees; man looks on the outward appearance, <em>but </em>the Lord&nbsp;looks on the heart.&rdquo; And Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, &ldquo;The Lord has not chosen these.&rdquo; And Samuel said to Jesse, &ldquo;Are all your sons here?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;There remains yet the youngest, but behold, he is keeping the sheep.&rdquo;.And Samuel said to Jesse, &ldquo;Send and fetch him; for we will not sit down till he comes here.&rdquo; And he sent, and brought &nbsp;him in. Now he was ruddy, and had beautiful eyes, and was handsome. And the Lord said, &ldquo;Arise, anoint him; for this is he.&rdquo; Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon David from that day forward.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">RESPONSORIAL PSALM Psalm 23 : I -3a.3b-4.5.6 (R. 1)</span><br />
<strong>R.</strong> <strong>The </strong><strong>Lord </strong><strong>is my shepherd; there is nothing</strong> <strong>I shall want.</strong></p>

<p>The Lord is my shepherd;<br />
there is nothing I shall want.<br />
Fresh and green are the pastures<br />
where he gives me repose.<br />
Near restful waters he leads me;<br />
he revives my soul. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p>He guides me along the right path,<br />
for the sake of his name.<br />
Though I should walk in the valley of the shadow of death,<br />
no evil would I fear, for you are with me.<br />
Your crook and your staff will give me comfort. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p>You have prepared a table before me<br />
in the sight of my foes.<br />
My head you have anointed with oil;<br />
my cup is overflowing. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>SECOND READING</strong><br />
<em>Arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light.&rdquo;</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Ephesians 5:8-14</span><br />
Brethren: Once you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord; walk as children of light (for the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true), and try to learn what&nbsp;is pleasing to the Lord. Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them. For it is a shame even to speak of the things that they do in secret; but when anything is exposed by the&nbsp;light it becomes visible, for anything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it is said, &ldquo;Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light.&rdquo;</p>

<em>&ldquo;He went and washed and came back seeing.&rdquo;</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to John John 9 : l -41</span><br />
At that time: As Jesus passed by, he saw a man blind from his birth. <span style="color:#ff0000">*</span>And his disciples asked him, &ldquo;Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?&rdquo; Jesus answered, &ldquo;It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of God might be made manifest in him. We must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day; night comes, when no one can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.&rdquo; As he said this, <span style="color:#ff0000">*</span> he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and anointed the man&rsquo;s eyes with the clay, saying to him, &ldquo;Go, wash in the pool of Siloam&rdquo; (which means Sent). So he went and washed and came back seeing. The neighbours and those who had seen him before as a beggar, said, &ldquo;Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?&rdquo; Some said, &ldquo;It is he&rdquo;; others said, &ldquo;No, but he is like him.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I am the man.&rdquo; *They said to him, &ldquo;Then how were your eyes opened?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;The man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me, &lsquo;Go to Siloam and wash&rsquo; ; so I went and washed and received my sight.&rdquo; They said to him, &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo; They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind. Now it was a sabbath day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes. The Pharisees again asked him how he had received his sight. And he said to them, &ldquo;He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.&rdquo; Some of the Pharisees said, &ldquo;This man is not from God, for he does not keep the sabbath.&rdquo; But others said, &ldquo;How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?&rdquo; There was a division among them. So they again said to the blind man, &ldquo;What do you say about him, since he has opened your eyes?&rdquo; He&nbsp; &nbsp;said, &ldquo;He is a prophet.&rdquo; <span style="color:#ff0000">* </span>The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight, and asked them, &ldquo;Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?&rdquo; His parents answered, &ldquo;We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; but how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of age, he will speak for himself.&rdquo; His parents said this because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if any one should confess him to be Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue. Therefore his parents said, &ldquo;He is of age, ask him.&rdquo; So for the second time they called the man who had been blind, and said to him, &ldquo;Give God the praise; we know that this man is a sinner.&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Whether he is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I know, that though I was blind, now I see.&rdquo; They said to him, &ldquo;What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?&rdquo; He answered them, &ldquo;I have told you already, and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you too want to become his disciples?&rdquo; And they reviled him, saying, &ldquo;You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.&rdquo; The man answered, &ldquo;Why, this is a marvel! You do not know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes. We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if any one is a worshipper of God and does his will, God listens to him. Never since the world began has it been heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind. If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.&rdquo; They answered him,<span style="color:#ff0000"> *</span> &ldquo;You were born in utter sin, and would you teach us?&rdquo; And they cast him out. Jesus heard&nbsp; that they had&nbsp;cast him out, and having found him he said, &ldquo;Do you believe in the Son of man?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;And who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;You have seen him, and it is he who speaks to you.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Lord, I believe&rdquo;; and he worshipped him. <span style="color:#ff0000">* </span>Jesus said, &ldquo;For judgement I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may become blind.&rdquo; Some of the Pharisees near him heard this, and they said to him, &ldquo;Are we also blind?&rdquo; Jesus said to them, &ldquo;If you were blind, you would have no guilt; but now that you say, &lsquo;We see,&rsquo; your guilt remains.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING</strong><br />
<em>No more </em><em>shall the sound of weeping be heard or the cry of distress.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading&nbsp;from the&nbsp;Book of Isaiah&nbsp;65 :17-21</span><br />
Thus says the Lord: Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered or come into mind. But be glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create; for behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy. I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and be glad in my people; no more shall be heard in it the sound of weeping or the cry of distress. No more shall there be in it an infant that lives but a few days, or an old man who does not fill out his days, for the child shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner a hundred years old shall be accursed. They shall build houses and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.</p>

Go, <em>your son will live.</em>&rdquo;<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to John&nbsp;4:43-54</span><br />
At that time: Jesus departed [from Samaria] to Galilee. For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honour in his own country. So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for they too had gone to the feast. So he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And at Capernaum there was an official whose son was ill. When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went and begged him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point&nbsp; of death.&nbsp; Jesus therefore&nbsp; said&nbsp; to him, &ldquo;Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe.&rdquo; The official said to him, &ldquo;Sir, come down before my child dies.&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Go; your son will live.&rdquo; The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went his way. As he was going down, his servants met him and told him that his son was living. So he asked them the hour when he began to mend, and they said to him, &ldquo;Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.&rdquo; The father knew that was the hour when Jesus had said to him, &ldquo;Your son will live&rdquo;; and he himself believed, and all his household. This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he had come from Judea to Galilee.</p>

<span style="display:none">&nbsp;</span><em>I saw water coming forth from the temple, and all those were saved to whom the water came.</em><br />
<span style="display:none">&nbsp;</span><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; Book&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Prophet Ezekiel&nbsp;47:1&mdash;9. 12</span><br />
In those days: [The angel] brought me back to the door of the temple; and behold, water was issuing from below the threshold of the temple towards the east (for the temple faced east); and the water was flowing down from below the right side of the threshold of the temple, south of the altar towards the east. Then he brought me out by way of the north gate, and led me round on the outside to the outer gate, that faces towards the east; and the water was coming out on the right side. Going on eastward with a line in his hand, the man measured a thousand cubits, and then led me through the water; and it was ankle-deep. Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water; and it was knee-deep. Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water; and it was up to the loins. Again he measured a thousand, and it was a river that I could not pass through, for the water had risen; it was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be passed through. And he said to me, &ldquo;Son of man, have you seen this?&rdquo; Then he led me back along the bank of the river. As I went back, I saw upon the bank of the river very many trees on the one side and on the other. And he said to me, &ldquo;This water flows towards the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah; and when it enters the stagnant waters of the sea, the water will become fresh. And wherever the river goes every living creature which swarms will live, and there will be very many fish; for this water goes there, that the waters of the sea may become fresh; so everything will live where the river goes. &ldquo;And on the banks, on both sides of the river, there will grow all kinds of trees for food. Their leaves will not wither nor their fruit fail, but they will bear fresh fruit every month, because the water for them flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for healing.&rdquo;</p>

<em>&ldquo;At once the man was healed.&rdquo;</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to John &nbsp;5:I - 16</span><br />
There was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool, in Hebrew called Bethzatha, which has five porticoes. In these lay a multitude of invalids, blind, lame, paralyzed. One man was there, who had been ill for thirty-eight years. When Jesus saw him and knew that he had been lying there a long time, he said to him, &ldquo;Do you want to be healed?&rdquo; The sick man answered him, &ldquo;Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is troubled, and while I am going another steps down before me.&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Rise, take up your pallet, and walk.&rdquo; And at once the man was healed, and he took up his pallet and walked. Now that day was the sabbath. So the Jews said to the man who was cured, &ldquo;It is the sabbath, it&nbsp; is not lawful for you to carry your pallet.&rdquo; But he answered them, &ldquo;The man who healed me said to me, &lsquo;Take up your pallet and walk. &rdquo;&rsquo; They asked him, &ldquo;Who is the man who said to you, &lsquo;Take up your pallet, and walk&rsquo;?&rdquo; Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, as there was a crowd in the place. Afterward, Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, &ldquo;See, you are well! Sin no more, that nothing worse befall you.&rdquo; The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him. And this was why the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did this on the sabbath.</p>

Thus says the Lord: &ldquo;In a time of favour I have answered you, in&nbsp; a day of salvation I have helped you; I have kept you and given you as a covenant to the people, to establish the land, to apportion the desolate heritages; saying to the prisoners, &lsquo;Come forth,&rsquo; to those who are in darkness, &lsquo;Appear.&rsquo; They shall feed along the ways, on all bare heights shall be their pasture; they shall not hunger or thirst, neither scorching wind nor sun shall strike them, for he who has pity on them will lead them, and by springs of water will guide them.

<em>&ldquo;As the Father </em><em>raises </em><em>the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will.&rdquo;</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">*A reading from the holy Gospel according to John 5:17-30</span><br />
At that time: Jesus answered the Jews, &ldquo;My Father is working still, and I am working.&rdquo; This was why the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the sabbath but also called God his Father, making himself equal with God. Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing; for whatever he does, that the Son does likewise. For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all that he himself is doing; and greater works than&nbsp; these&nbsp; will he&nbsp; show him, that&nbsp; you&nbsp; may&nbsp; marvel.&nbsp;For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will. The Father judges no&nbsp; one, but has given all judgement to the Son, that all may honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He who does not honour the Son does not honour the Father who sent him. Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears my word and believes him who sent me, has eternal life; he does not come into judgement, but has passed from death to life. &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself, and has given him authority to execute judgement, because he is the Son of man. Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice and come forth, those who have done good, to the resurrection&nbsp; of life, and those who have done evil,&nbsp;to the resurrection of judgement. &ldquo;I can do nothing on my own authority; as I hear, I judge; and my judgement is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me.&rdquo;</p>

<em>&ldquo;Repent of this evil against your people.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Exodus &nbsp;32:7- 14</span><br />
In those days: The Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Go down; for your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves; they have turned aside quickly&nbsp; out&nbsp; of the way which I commanded them; they have made for themselves a molten calf, and have worshipped it and sacrificed to it, and said, &lsquo;These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!&rdquo;&rsquo; And the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people; now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them and I may consume them; but of you I will make a great nation.&rdquo; But Moses begged the Lord his God, and said, &ldquo;O Lord, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, whom you have brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand? Why should the Egyptians say, &lsquo;With evil intent he brought them forth, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against your people. Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you did swear by your own self, and did say to them, &#39;I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have promised I will give to your descendants, and they shall inherit it for ever. &rdquo;&rsquo; And the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do to his people.</p>

<p>you&nbsp; show to your&nbsp; people.<br />
They fashioned a calf at Horeb,<br />
and worshipped an image of metal,<br />
they exchanged their glory<br />
for the image of a bull that eats grass.<span style="color:#ff0000"> R.</span></p>

who had done such great things in Egypt,<br />
such wonders in the land of Ham,<br />
such marvels at the Red Sea. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span><br />

<em>It is Moses who accuses you, on whom you set your hope.&rdquo;</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to John 5:31-47</span><br />
At that time: Jesus said to the Jews, &ldquo;If I bear witness to myself, my testimony is not true; there is another who bears witness to me, and I know that the testimony which he bears to me is true. You sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth. Not that the testimony which I receive is from man; but I say this that you may be saved. He was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light. But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John; for the works which the Father has granted me to accomplish, these very works which I am doing, bear me witness that the Father has sent me. And the Father who sent me has himself borne witness to me. His voice you have never heard, his form you have never seen; and you do not have his word abiding in you, for you do not believe him whom he has sent. You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness to me; yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life. I do not receive glory from men. But I know that you have not the love of God within you. I have come in my Father&rsquo;s name, and you do not receive me; if another comes in his own name, him you will receive. How can you believe, who receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God? Do not think that I shall accuse you to the Father;&nbsp; it is Moses who accuses you, on whom you set your hope. If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote of me. But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?&rdquo;</p>

<em>&ldquo;Let us condemn him to a shameful death.&rdquo;</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Wisdom (Wisdom 2:la.12-22)</span><br />
Ungodly men reasoned unsoundly, saying to themselves, &ldquo;Let us lie in wait for the righteous man, because he is inconvenient to&nbsp;us and opposes our actions; he reproaches us for sins against the law, and accuses us of sins against our training. He professes to have knowledge of God, and calls himself a child of the Lord. He became to us a reproof of our thoughts; the very sight of him is a burden to us, because his manner of life is unlike that of others, and his ways are strange. We are considered by him as something base, and he avoids our ways&nbsp; as unclean;&nbsp;he&nbsp;calls the&nbsp; last end&nbsp; of the righteous happy, and boasts&nbsp; that&nbsp; God&nbsp; is his&nbsp; father. Let us&nbsp; see if his words are true, and let us test what will happen at the end of his life; for if the righteous man is God&rsquo;s son, he will help him, and will deliver him from the hand of his adversaries. Let&nbsp; us test him with insult and torture, that we may&nbsp; find&nbsp; out&nbsp; how&nbsp; gentle he is, and make trial of his forbearance. Let us condemn him to a shameful death, for, according to what he says, he will be protected.&rdquo; Thus they reasoned, but they were led astray, for their wickedness blinded them, and they did not know the secret purposes of God, nor hope for the wages of holiness, nor discern the prize for blameless souls.</p>

<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to&nbsp;&nbsp;John&nbsp;7: 1-2.10.25-30</span><br />
At that time: Jesus went about in Galilee; he would not go about in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him. Now the Jews&rsquo; feast of Tabernacles was at hand. But after his brethren had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly but in private. Some of the people of Jerusalem therefore said, &ldquo;Is not this the man whom they seek to kill? And here he is, speaking openly, and they say nothing to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that this is the Christ? Yet we know where this man comes from; and when the Christ appears, no one will know where he comes from.&rdquo; So Jesus proclaimed, as he taught in the temple, &ldquo;You know me, and you know where I come from; But I have not come of my own accord; he who sent me is true, and him you do not know. I know him, for I come from him, and he sent me.&rdquo; So they sought to arrest him; but no one laid hands on him, because his hour had not yet come.</p>

At that time: When they heard the words of Jesus, some of the people said, This is really the prophet. Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Is the Christ to come from Galilee? Has not the Scripture said that the Christ is descended from David, and comes from Bethlehem, the village where David was? So there was a division among the people over him. Some of them wanted to arrest him, but no one laid hands on him. The officers then went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, Why did you not bring him? The officers answered, No man ever spoke like this man! The Pharisees answered them, Are you led astray, you also? Have any of the authorities or of thy Pharisees believed in him? But this crowd, who do not know the law, are accursed. Nicodemus, who had gone to him before, and who was one of them, said to them, Does our law judge a man without first giving him a hearing and learning what he does? They replied, Are you from Galilee too? Search and you will see that no prophet is to rise from Galilee. They went each to his own house.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Sunday</span>: <strong>Jesus: The Lord of Life.</strong> The three readings today are centred on the life that God gives to all people. The first reading introduces us to the theme through the prophecy of Ezekiel that gave Israel hope of resurrection. The Gospel presents the new message brought by Jesus. It is no longer a matter of resurrection on the last day, but the gift of new life that prevents a person from dying. In the second reading Paul speaks of the Spirit, the agent of Christ&#39;s resurrection and of ours too.</p>

Brethren: Those who are in the flesh cannot please God. But you are not in the flesh, you are in the Spirit, if the Spirit of God really dwells in you. Any one who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. But if Christ is in you, although your bodies are dead because of sin, your spirits are alive because of righteousness.

At that time<strong>:</strong> A certain man was ill, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. It was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ill. So * the sisters sent to him, saying, Lord, he whom you love is ill. But when Jesus heard it he said, This illness is not unto death; it is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified by means of it. Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. So when he heard that he was ill, he stayed two days longer in the place where he was. Then after this he said to the disciples, Let us go into Judea again. <span style="color:#ff0000">*</span></p>

<p>The disciples said to him, Rabbi, the Jews were but now seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any one walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world. But if any one walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him. Thus he spoke, and then he said to them, Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to awake him out of sleep. The disciples said to him, Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover. Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep. Then Jesus told them plainly, Lazarus is dead; and for your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.Thomas, called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">* </span>Now when Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days.* Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off, and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother. * When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, while Mary sat in the house. Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. And even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give you. Jesus said to her, Your brother will rise again. Martha said to him, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day. Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this? She said to him, Yes, Lord; I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, he who is coming into the world. * When she had said this, she went and called her sister Mary, saying quietly, The Teacher is here and is calling for you. And when she heard it, she rose quickly and went to him. Now Jesus had not yet come to the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him. When the Jews who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw Mary rise quickly and go out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there. Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was and saw him, fell at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, <span style="color:#ff0000">* </span>he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled; and he said, Where have you laid him? They said to him, Lord, come and see. Jesus wept. So the Jews said, See how he loved him! But some of them said, Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying? Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb; it was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. Jesus said, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, Lord, by this time there will be an odour, for he has been dead four days. Jesus said to her, Did I not tell you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God? So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, Father, I thank you that you have heard me. I knew that you always hear me, but I have said this on account of the people standing by, that they may believe that you have sent me. When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come out. The dead man came out, his hands and feet bound with bandages, and his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, Unbind him, and let him go. Many of the Jews therefore, who had come with Mary and had seen what he did, believed in him.</p>

<em>Now I am to die, yet I have done none of these things.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of the Prophet Daniel (Daniel 13: I -9.1 5-17.19-30.33-62)</span><br />
In those days: There was a man living in Babylon whose name was Joakim. And he took a wife named Susanna, the daughter of Hilkiah, a very beautiful woman and one who feared the Lord. Her parents were righteous, and had taught their daughter according to the law of Moses. Joakim was very rich, and had a spacious garden adjoining his house; and the Jews used to come to him because he was the most honoured of them all. In that year two elders from the people were appointed as judges. Concerning them the Lord had said: Iniquity came forth from Babylon, from elders who were judges, who were supposed to govern the people. These men were frequently at Joakim&rsquo;s house, and all who had suits at law came to them. When the people departed at moon, Susanna would go into her husband&rsquo;s garden to walk. The two elders used to see her every day, going in and walking about, and they began to desire her. And they perverted their minds and turned away their eyes from looking to Heaven or remembering righteous judgements. Once, while they were watching for an opportune day, she went in as before with only two maids, and wished to bathe in the garden, for it was very hot. And no one was there except the two elders, who had hid themselves and were watching her. She said to her maids, &ldquo;Bring me oil and ointments, and shut the garden doors so that I may bathe.&rdquo; When the maids had gone out, the two elders rose and ran to her, and said: &ldquo;Look, the garden doors are shut, no one sees us, and we are in love with you, so give your consent, and lie with us. If you refuse, we will testify against you that a young man was with you, and this was why you sent your maids away.&rdquo; Susanna sighed deeply, and said, &ldquo;I am hemmed in on every side. For if I do this thing, it is death for me; and if I do not, I shall not escape your hands. I choose not to do it and to fall into your hands, rather than to sin in the sight of the Lord.&rdquo; Then Susanna cried out with a loud voice, and the two elders shouted against her. And one of them ran and opened the garden doors. When the household servants heard the shouting in the garden, they rushed in at the side door to see what had happened to her. And when the elders told their tale, the servants were greatly ashamed, for nothing like this had ever been said about Susanna. The next day, when the people gathered at the house of her husband Joakim, the two elders came, full of their wicked plot to have Susanna put to death. They said before the people, &ldquo;Send for Susanna, the daughter of Hilkiah, who is the wife of Joakim.&rdquo; So they sent for her. And she came, with her parents, her children, and all her kindred. But her family and friends and all who saw her wept. Then the two elders stood up in the midst of the people, and laid their hands upon her head. And she, weeping, looked up towards heaven, for her heart trusted in the Lord. The elders said, &ldquo;As we were walking in the garden alone, this woman came in with two maids, shut the garden doors, and dismissed the maids. Then a young man, who had been hidden, came to her and lay with her. We were in a corner of the garden, and when we saw this wickedness we ran to them. We saw them embracing, but we could not hold the man, for he was too strong for us, and he opened the doors and dashed out. So we seized this woman and asked her who the young man was, but she would not tell us. These things we testify.&rdquo; The assembly believed them, because they were elders of the people and judges; and they condemned her to death. Then Susanna cried out with a loud voice, and said, &ldquo;O eternal God, who discern what is secret, who are aware of all things before they come to be, you know that these men have borne false witness against me. And now I am to die! Yet I have done none of the things that they have wickedly invented against me!&rdquo; The Lord heard her cry. And as she was being led away to be put to death God aroused the holy spirit of a young lad named Daniel; and he cried with a loud voice, &ldquo;I am innocent of the blood of this woman.&rdquo; All the people turned to him, and said, &ldquo;What is this that you have said?&rdquo; Taking his stand in the midst of them, he said, &ldquo;Are you such fools, you sons of Israel? Have you condemned a daughter of Israel without examination and without learning the facts? Return to the place of judgement. For these men have borne false witness against her.&rdquo; Then all the people returned in haste. And the elders said to him, &ldquo;Come, sit among us and inform us, for God has given you that right.&rdquo; And Daniel said to them, &ldquo;Separate them far from each other, and I will examine them.&rdquo; When they were separated from each other, he summoned one of them and said to him, &ldquo;You old relic of wicked days, your sins have now come home, which you have committed in the past, pronouncing unjust judgements, condemning the innocent and letting the guilty go free, though the Lord said, &lsquo;Do not put to death an innocent and righteous person.&rsquo; Now then, if you really saw her, tell me this: Under what tree did you see them being intimate with each other?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Under a mastic tree.&rdquo; And Daniel said, &ldquo;Very well! You have lied against your own head, for the angel of God has received the sentence from God and will immediately cut you in two.&rdquo; Then he put him aside, and commanded them to bring the other. And he said to him, &ldquo;You offspring of Canaan and not of Judah, beauty has deceived you and lust has perverted your heart. This is how you both have been dealing with the daughters of Israel, and they were intimate with you through fear; but a daughter of Judah would not endure your wickedness. Now then, tell me: Under what tree did you catch them being intimate with each other?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Under an evergreen oak.&rdquo; And Daniel said to him, &ldquo;Very well! You also have lied against your own head, for the angel of God is waiting with his sword to saw you in two, that he may destroy you both.&rdquo; Then all the assembly shouted loudly and blessed God, who saves those who hope in him. And they rose against the two elders, for out of their own mouths Daniel had convicted them of bearing false witness; and they did to them as they had wickedly planned to do to their neighbour; acting in accordance with the law of Moses, they put them to death. Thus innocent blood was saved that day.</p>

<p>At that time: Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. Early in the morning he came again to the temple; all the people came to him, and he sat down and taught them. The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and placing her in their midst they said to him, Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery. Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such. What do you say about her? This they said to test him, that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. And as they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her. And once more he bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. But when they heard it, they went away, one by one, beginning with the eldest, and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. Jesus looked up and said to her, Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you? She said, No one, Lord. And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn you; go, and do not sin again.</p>

In those days: From Mount Hor the Hebrews set out by the way to the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom; and the people became impatient on the way. And the people spoke against God and against Moses, Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we loathe this worthless food. Then the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many people of Israel died. And the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord and against you; pray to the Lord, that he take away the serpents from us. So Moses prayed for the people. And the Lord said to Moses, Make a fiery serpent, and set it up as a sign; and every one who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live. So Moses made a bronze serpent, and set it up as a sign; and if a serpent bit any man, he would look at the bronze serpent and live.</p>

I told you that you would die in your sins, for you will die in your sins unless you believe that I am he. They said to him, Who are you? Jesus said to them, Even what I have told you from the beginning. I have much to say about you and much to judge; but he who sent me is true, and I declare to the world what I have heard from him. They did not understand that he spoke to them of the Father. So Jesus said, When you have lifted up the Son of man, then you will know that I am he, and that I do nothing on my own authority but speak thus as the Father taught me. And he who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what is pleasing to him. As he spoke thus, many believed in him.</p>

In those days: King Nebuchadnezzar said, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image which I have set up? Now if you are ready when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music to fall down and worship the image which I have made, well and good; but if you do not worship, you shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace; and who is the god that will deliver you out of my hands? Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered the king, &ldquo;O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. If it be so, our God, whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king. But if not, be it known to you, O king,that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up.&rdquo; Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury, and the expression of his face was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He ordered the furnace heated seven times more than it was accustomed to be heated. And he ordered certain mighty men of his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. Then King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished and rose up in haste. He said to his counsellors, &ldquo;Did we not cast three men bound into the fire? They answered the king, &ldquo;True, O king.&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;But I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they are not hurt; and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods.&rdquo; Nebuchadnezzar said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants, who trusted in him, and set at nought the king&rsquo;s command, and yielded up their bodies rather than serve and worship any god except their own God.;</p>

I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you.

Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham&rsquo;s children, you would do what Abraham did, but now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God; this is not what Abraham did. You do the works of your father.&rdquo; They said to him, &ldquo;We were not born of fornication;. we have one Father, even God.&rdquo; Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, you would love me, for I proceeded and came forth from God; I came not of my own accord, but he sent me.&rdquo;</p>

If he called them gods to whom the word of God came (and Scripture cannot be nullified), do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, You are blaspheming, because I said, I am the Son of God? If I am not doing the works of my Father, then do not believe me; but if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father. Again they tried to arrest him, but he escaped from their hands. He went away again across the Jordan to the place where John at first baptised, and there he remained.

My dwelling place shall be with them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Then the nations will know that I the Lord sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary is in the midst of them for evermore.</p>

<em>Together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.</em></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to John (John 11:45-57)</span><br />
At that time: Many of the Jews who had come with Mary and had seen what Jesus did, believed in him; but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the council, and said, What are we to do? For this man performs many signs. If we let him go on like this, every one will believe in him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our holy place and our nation. But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, You know nothing at all; you do not understand that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation should not perish. He did not say this of his own accord, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation, and not for the nation only, but to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad. So from that day on they took counsel about how to put him to death. Jesus therefore no longer went about openly among the Jews, but went from there to the country near the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim; and there he stayed with the disciples. Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves. They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, What do you think? That he will not come to the feast?Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if any one knew where he was, he should let them know, so that they might arrest him.</p>

<p>Sunday April 9, 2017<br />
Holy Week. (Palm Sunday)<br />
Vestment: Red<br />
Today&#39;s Rosary: The Glorious Mysteries</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">HOLY WEEK</span><br />
Pastors should take care to instruct the faithful on the meaning and structure of the rites enacted in these days, and so lead them to an active and fruitful participation. Lent continues until Maundy Thursday. Easter Triduum begins at the Lord&rsquo;s Supper and concludes with Vespers on Easter Sunday.<br />
The days of Holy Week, from Monday to Thursday inclusive, have precedence over all other celebrations.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">PALM SUNDAY OR THE PASSION OF THE LORD.</span><br />
This is a day which the Church enters upon the mystery of the Death, Burial and Resurrection of her Lord, brings together the triumphal procession of Christ as king and the proclamation of His Passion.</p>

<p>On this day the Church recalls the entrance of Christ the Lord into Jerusalem to accomplish his paschal mystery. This takes place at all Masses accordingly.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Sunday:</span> <strong>Jesus Gives up His Life.</strong> The evangelists do not report the passion and death of Jesus to play on our emotions. They show us Christ who gave up his life for love of all people. The first reading tells us what happens to those who are faithful to this mission God has entrusted to them. The Gospel presents us with the only one who has fully realized in himself the image of servant. The second reading describes the journey of this servant from glory of the Father to the humiliation of the death on the cross, to the glorification of his resurrection. This is the path proposed to every person. The whole group of believers was united heart and soul; no one claimed for his own use anything that he had, as everything they owned was held in common (Acts 4:32).</p>

<hr />
<p><span style="color:#ff0000">THE PROCESSION</span><br />
<span style="color:#b22222">At an appropriate hour, a gathering takes place at a smaller church or other suitable place other than inside the church to which the procession will go. The faithful hold branches in their hands. Wearing the red sacred vestments as for Mass, the Priest and the Deacon, accompanied by other ministers, approach the place where the people are gathered. Instead of the chasuble, the Priest may wear a cope, which he leaves aside when the procession is over, and puts on a chasuble. Meanwhile, the following antiphon or another appropriate chant is sung.</span></p>

<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Entrance Ant. Mt 21:9<br />
Hosanna to the Son of David, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel: Hosanna in the highest.</span></p>

<p>After this, the Priest and people sign themselves, while the Priest says: In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Then he greets the people in the usual way. A brief address is given, in which the faithful are invited to participate actively and consciously in the celebration of this day, in these or similar words:</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Dear brethren (brothers and sisters)</span>, since the beginning of Lent until now we have prepared our hearts by penance and charitable works. Today we gather together to herald with the whole Church the beginning of the celebration of our Lord&rsquo;s paschal mystery, that is to say, of his Passion and Resurrection. For it was to accomplish this mystery that he entered his own city of Jerusalem. Therefore, with all faith and devotion, let us commemorate the Lord&rsquo;s entry into the city for our salvation, following in his footsteps, so that being made by his grace partakers of the Cross, we may have a share also in his Resurrection and in his life.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">After the address, the Priest says one of the following prayers with hands extended.</span></p>

<p>Let us pray.<br />
Almighty ever-living God, sanctify these branches with your blessing, that we who follow Christ the King in exultation, may reach the eternal Jerusalem through him. Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></strong> Amen.</p>

<p>Increase the faith of those who place their hope in you, O God, and graciously hear the prayers of those who call on you: that be who today hold high these branches to hail Christ in his triumph, may bear fruit for you by good works accomplished in him. Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></strong> Amen.</p>

<p>He sprinkles the branches with holy water without saying anything. Then a Deacon or, if there is no Deacon, a Priest, proclaims in the usual way the Gospel concerning the Lord&rsquo;s entrance according to one of the four Gospels.. If appropriate, incense may be used.</p>

<p>Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.</p>

<hr />
<p>GOSPEL<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew (Matthew 21: I -11 I)</span><br />
When they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them, &ldquo;Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to me. If any one says anything to you, you shall say, &lsquo;The Lord has need of them,&rsquo; and he will send them immediately.&rdquo; This took place to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet, saying, &ldquo;Tell the daughter of Zion, Behold, your king is coming to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.&rdquo; The disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them; they brought the donkey and the colt, and put their garments on them, and he sat thereon. Most of the crowd spread their garments on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. And the crowds that went before him and that followed him shouted, &ldquo;Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!&rdquo; And when he entered Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, &ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; And the crowds said, &ldquo;This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Gospel of the Lord.</p>

<hr />
<p><span style="color:#ff0000">After the Gospel, a brief homily may be given. Then, to begin the Procession, an invitation may be given by a Priest or a Deacon or a lay minister, in these or similar words:</span></p>

<p>Dear brethren (brothers and sisters), like the crowds who acclaimed Jesus in Jerusalem, let us go forth in peace.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Or:</span> Let us go forth in peace.</p>

<p>In this latter case, all respond: In the name of Christ. <span style="color:#ff0000">Amen.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">The Procession to the church where Mass will be celebrated then sets&nbsp; off in the usual way. As the Procession moves forward, the following or other suitable chants in honour of Christ the King are sung by the choir and people.</span></p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:center">AT THE MASS<br />
After the Procession or Solemn Entrance the Priest begins the Mass with the Collect.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Collect</span><br />
Almighty everlasting God, who as an example of humility for&nbsp; the human race to follow caused our Saviour to take flesh and submit to the cross, graciously grant that we may heed his lesson of patient suffering and so merit a share in his Resurrection. Who lives and reigns with you . . .</p>

<p><br />

<p>FIRST READING<br />
I hid not my face from shame, and I know I shall not be put to shame. Third song of the Servant of the Lord.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Isaiah (Isaiah 50:4-70)</span><br />
The Lord God has given me the tongue of those who are taught, that I may know how to sustain with a word him that is weary. Morning by morning he wakens, he wakens my ear to hear as those who are taught. The Lord God has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, I turned not backward. I gave my back to those who struck me, and my cheeks to those who pulled out the beard; I hid not my face from shame and spitting. For the Lord God helps me; therefore I have not been confounded; therefore I have set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be put to shame.</p>

<p>The word of the Lord.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">RESPONSORIAL PSALM Ps.22:8-9.17-18a.19-20.23-24&nbsp; (R. 2a)</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000"><strong>R.</strong></span><strong> My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?</strong><br />
All who see me deride me;<br />
they curl their lips, they toss their heads:<br />
He trusted in the Lord, let him save him;<br />
let him release him, for in him he delights.<span style="color:#ff0000"> R.</span></p>

<p>For dogs have surrounded me;<br />
a band of the wicked besets me.<br />
They tear holes in my hands and my feet;<br />
I can count every one of my bones. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p>They divide my clothing among them,<br />
they cast lots for my&nbsp; robe.<br />
But you, O Lord, do not stay afar off;<br />
my strength, make haste to help me! <span style="color:#ff0000">R</span>.</p>

<p>I will tell of your name to my kin,<br />
and praise you in the midst of the assembly;<br />
You who fear the Lord, give him praise;<br />
all descendents of Jacob, give him glory;<br />
revere him, all you descendents of Israel.&rdquo; <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>SECOND READING<br />
He humbled himself, and God has highly exalted him<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Philippians (Philippians 2:6-11)</span><br />
Christ Jesus, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>

<p>The word of the Lord.</p>

<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">VERSE BEFORE THE GOSPEL Philippians 2:8b-9</span><br />
<strong>Glory and praise to you, O Christ.</strong> Christ became obedient for us unto death, even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly exalted him: and bestowed on him the name which is above every name. <strong>Glory and praise to you, O Christ.</strong></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">The narrative of the Lords Passion is read without candles and without incense, with no greeting or signing of the book. It is read by a Deacon or, if there is no Deacon, by a Priest. It may also be read by readers, with the part of Christ, if possible, reserved to a Priest. Deacons, but not others, ask for the blessing of the Priest before singing the Passion, as at other times before the Gospel.</span></p>

<p><strong>The Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ according to Matthew</strong></p>

<p>N. At that time: One of the Twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and said,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S</span>. What will you give me if I deliver him to you?</p>

<p>N. And they paid him thirty pieces of silver. And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him.<br />
Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S. </span>Where will you have us prepare for you to eat the Passover?&rdquo;</p>

<p>N. He said,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+</span>. Go into the city to such a one, and say to him, &lsquo;The Teacher says, my time is at hand; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.</p>

<p>N. And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover.<br />
When it was evening, he sat at table with the twelve disciples; and as they were eating, he said,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+. </span>Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.</p>

<p>N. And they were very sorrowful, and began to say to him one after another,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S</span>. Is it I, Lord</p>

<p>N. He answered,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+.</span> He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me, will betray me.<br />
The Son of man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.</p>

<p>N. Judas, who betrayed him, said,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S.</span> Is it I, Master?</p>

<p>N. He said to him,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+. </span>You have said so.</p>

<p>N. Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+. </span>Take, eat; this is my body.</p>

<p>N. And he took a chalice, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+.</span> Drink of it, all of you; for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you I shall not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father&#39;s kingdom.</p>

<p>N. And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. Then Jesus said to them,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+.</span> You will all fall away because of me this night; for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered. But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee.</p>

<p>N. Peter declared to him,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S</span>. Though they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away.</p>

<p>N. Jesus said to him,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+.</span> Truly, I say to you, this very night, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times.</p>

<p>N. Peter said to him,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S.</span> Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>N. And so said all the disciples.<br />
Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+. </span>Sit here, while I go over there and pray.</p>

<p>N. And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled. Then he said to them.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+.</span> My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me.</p>

<p>N. And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+</span>. My Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.</p>

<p>N. And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+.</span> So, could you not watch with me one hour? Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</p>

<p>N. Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+.</span> My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done.</p>

<p>N. And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. So, leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words. Then he came to the disciples and said to them,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+</span>. Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.</p>

<p>N. While he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the Twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people. Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S</span>. The one I shall kiss is the man; seize him.</p>

<p>N. And he came up to Jesus at once and said,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S.</span> Hail, Master!</p>

<p>N. And he kissed him. Jesus said to him,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+</span>. Friend, why are you here?</p>

<p>N. Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him. And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest, and cut off his ear. Then Jesus said to him,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+.</span> Put your sword back into its place; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword. Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels? But how then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?</p>

<p>N. At that hour Jesus said to the crowds,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+</span>. Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. But all this has taken place, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.</p>


<p>N. Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.<br />
Then those who had seized Jesus led him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered. But Peter followed him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and going inside he sat with the guards to see the end. Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death, but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward and said,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S</span>. This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</p>

<p>N. And the high priest stood up and said,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S</span>. Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?</p>

<p>N. But Jesus was silent. And the high priest said to him,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S</span>. I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.</p>

<p>N. Jesus said to him,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+</span>. You have said so. But I tell you, hereafter you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.</p>

<p>N. Then the high priest tore his robes, and said,</p>

<p>S. He has uttered blasphemy. Why do we still need witnesses? You have now heard his blasphemy. What is your judgement?</p>

<p>N. They answered,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S.</span> He deserves death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>N. Then they spat in his face, and struck him; and some slapped him, saying,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S</span>. Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is it that struck you?</p>

<p>N. Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a maid came up to him, and said,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S.</span> You also were with Jesus the Galilean.</p>

<p>N. But he denied it before them all, saying,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S.</span> I do not know what you &nbsp;mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>N. And when he went out to the porch, another maid saw him, and she said to the bystanders,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S. </span>This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.</p>

<p>N. And again he denied it with an oath,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S.</span> I do not know, the man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>N. After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S.</span> Certainly you are also one of them, for your accent betrays you.</p>

<p>N. Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S</span>. I do not know the man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>N. And immediately the cock crowed. And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times. And he went out and wept bitterly.<br />
When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death; and they bound him and led him away and delivered him to Pilate the governor. When Judas, his betrayer, saw that he was condemned, he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders, saying,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S</span>. I have sinned in betraying innocent blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>N. They said,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S</span>. What is that to us? See to it yourself.</p>

<p>N. And throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed; and he went and hanged himself. But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S</span>. It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since they are blood money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>N. So they took counsel, and bought with them the potter&rsquo;s field, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day. Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter&#39;s field, as the Lord directed me.</p>

<p>*Now Jesus stood before the governor; and the governor asked him,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S</span>. Are you the King of the Jews?</p>

<p>N. Jesus said to him,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+</span>. You have said so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>N. But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he made no answer. Then Pilate said to him,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S.</span> Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?</p>

<p>N. But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge; so that the governor wondered greatly.<br />
Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted. And they had then a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas. So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S.</span> Whom do you want me to release for you, Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?</p>

<p>N. For he knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered him up. Besides, while he was sitting on the judgement seat, his wife sent word to him, Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much over him today in a dream. Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the people to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus. The governor again said to them,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S. </span>Which of the two do you want me to release for you?</p>

<p>N. And they said,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S</span>. Barabbas.</p>

<p>N. Pilate said to them,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S.</span> Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?</p>

<p>N. They all said,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S.</span> Let him be crucified.&rdquo;</p>

<p>N. And he said,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S</span>. Why, what evil has he done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>N. But they shouted all the more,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S</span>. Let him be crucified.&rdquo;</p>

<p>N. So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S</span>. I am innocent of this righteous man&#39;s blood; see to it yourselves.</p>

<p>N. And all the people answered,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S</span>. His blood be on us and on our children!&rdquo;</p>

<p>N. Then he released for them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified. Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the praetorium, and they gathered the whole battalion before him. And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe upon him, and plaiting a crown of thorns they put it on his head, and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him they mocked him, saying,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S</span>. Hail, King of the Jews!</p>

<p>N. And they spat upon him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.<br />
And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of &nbsp;&nbsp;the robe, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him. As they were marching out, they came upon a man of Cyrene, Simon by name; this man they compelled to carry his cross. And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means the place of a skull), they offered him wine to drink, mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not drink it. And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots; then they sat down and &nbsp;&nbsp;kept watch over him there. And over his head they put the charge against him, which read, &ldquo;This is Jesus the King of the Jews.&rdquo; Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left. And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads, and saying,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S</span>. You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.</p>

<p>N. So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S</span>. He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him; for he said, I am the Son of God.</p>

<p>N. And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him<br />
in the same way.<br />
Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+.</span> &quot;Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?</p>

<p>N. that is<br />
&quot;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?</p>

<p>N. And some of the bystanders hearing it said,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S.</span> This man is calling Elijah.</p>

<p>N. And one of them at once ran and took a sponge, filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink. But the others said,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S</span>. Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>N. And Jesus cried again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">All kneel and pause for a moment.</span></p>

<p>N. And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom; and the earth shook, and the rocks were split; the tombs also were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many. When the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with awe, and said,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S</span>. Truly this was the Son of God!&rdquo; *</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N. </span>There were also many women there, looking on from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him; among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus. He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. And Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud, and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn in the rock; and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb. Next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate and said,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S.</span> Sir, we remember how that impostor said, while he was still alive, After three days I will rise again. Therefore order the tomb to be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples go and steal him away, and tell the people, &lsquo;He has risen from the dead,&rsquo; and the last fraud will be worse than the first.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N. </span>Pilate said to them,</p>

<p><span style="color:#b22222">S</span>. You have a guard of soldiers; go, make it as secure as you can.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N.</span> So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard.</p>

<p>(Shorter form: Matthew 27: 11-54.)</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">After the narrative of the Passion, a brief homily should take place, if appropriate. A period of silence may also be observed.<br />
The Creed is said, and the Universal Prayer takes place.</span></p>

Behold my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights; I have put my Spirit upon him, he will bring forth justice to the nations. He will not cry or lift up his voice, or make it heard in the street; a bruised reed he will not break, and a dimly burning wick he will not quench; he will faithfully bring forth justice. He will not fail or be discouraged till he has established justice in the earth; and the islands wait for his law. Thus says God, the Lord, who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread forth the earth and what comes from it, who gives breath to the people upon it and spirit to those who walk in it: I am the Lord, I have called you in righteousness, I have taken you by the hand and kept you; I have given you as a covenant to the people, a light to the nations, to open the eyes that are blind, to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, from the prison those who sit in darkness.</p>

<em>Let her keep it for the day of my burial.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to John (John 12.1-11)</span><br />
Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. There they made him a supper; Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those at table with him. Mary took a pound of costly ointment of pure nard and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment. But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (he who was to betray him), said, Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor? This he said, not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief, and as he had the money box he used to take what was put into it. Jesus said, Let her alone, let her keep it for the day of my burial. The poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me. When the great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, they came, not only on account of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. So the chief priests planned to put Lazarus also to death, because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus.</p>

<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to John (John l3:21&mdash;33:36-38)</span><br />
At that time: [Jesus, reclining with his disciples,] was troubled in spirit, and testified, Truly, truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me. The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he spoke. One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was lying close to the breast of Jesus; so Simon Peter beckoned to him and said, Tell us who it is of whom he speaks. So lying thus, close to the breast of Jesus, he said to him, Lord, who is it? Jesus answered, It is he to whom I shall give this morsel when I have dipped it. So when he had dipped the morsel, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. Then after the morsel, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, What you are going to do, do quickly. Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him. Some thought that, because Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling him, Buy what we need for the feast or, that he should give something to the poor. So, after receiving the morsel, he immediately went out; and it was night. When he had gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and in him God is glorified; if God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and glorify him at once. Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me; and as I said to the Jews so now I say to you, &lsquo;Where I am going you cannot come. Simon Peter said to him, Lord, where are you going? Jesus answered, Where I am going you cannot follow me now; but you shall follow afterward. Peter said to him, Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for you. Jesus answered, &ldquo;Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the cock will not crow, till you have denied me three times.</p>

He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord. And he closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant, and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. And he began to say to them, Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.</p>

<p>The Gospel of the Lord.</p>

<hr />
<p><span style="color:#ff0000">After the reading of the Gospel, the Bishop preaches the Homily in which, taking his starting point from the text of the readings proclaimed in the Liturgy of the Word, he speaks to the people and to his Priests about priestly anointing, urging the Priests to be faithful in their office and calling on them to renew publicly their priestly promises.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>THURSDAY OF THE LORD&rsquo;S SUPPER</strong><br />
At the Evening Mass</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">The Mass of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper is celebrated in the evening, at a convenient time, with the full participation of the whole local community and with all the Priests and ministers exercising their office. All Priests may concelebrate even if they have already concelebrated the Chrism Mass on this day, or if they have to celebrate another Mass for the good of the Christian faithful.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Where a pastoral reason requires it, the local Ordinary may permit another Mass to be celebrated in churches and oratories in the evening and, in case of genuine necessity, even in the morning, but only for the faithful who are in no way able to participate in the evening Mass. Care should, nevertheless, be taken that celebrations of this sort do not take place for the advantage of private persons or special small groups, and do not prejudice the evening Mass.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Holy Communion may only be distributed to the faithful during Mass; but it may be brought to the sick at any hour of the day.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">The altar may be decorated with flowers with a moderation that accords with the character of this day. The tabernacle should be entirely empty; but a sufficient amount of hosts should be consecrated in this Mass for the Communion of the clergy and the people on this and the following day.</span></p>

O God, who have called us to participate in this most sacred Supper, in which your Only Begotten Son, when about to hand himself over to death, entrusted to the Church a sacrifice new for all eternity, the banquet of his love, grant, we pray, that we may draw from so great a mystery, the fullness of charity and of life.

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Exodus&nbsp;&nbsp;(Exodus 12:1-8. 11-14)</span></p>

<p>In those days: The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, &ldquo;This month shall be for you the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year for you. Tell all the congregation of Israel that on the tenth day of this month they&nbsp; shall take every man a lamb according to their fathers&rsquo; houses, a lamb for&nbsp;&nbsp; a household; and if the household is too small for a lamb, then a man and his neighbour next to his house shall take according to the number of persons; according to what each can eat you shall make your count for the lamb. Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old; you shall take it from the sheep or from the goats; and you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month, when the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill their lambs in the evening. Then they shall take some of the blood, and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses in which they eat them. They shall eat the flesh that night, roasted; with unleavened bread and bitter herbs they shall eat it. &ldquo;In this manner you shall eat it: your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste. It is the LORD&rsquo;s Passover.&nbsp; For&nbsp; I will pass&nbsp; through the&nbsp; land of Egypt that night, and I will strike all the firstborn in the land&nbsp;&nbsp; of Egypt, both man and beast; and on all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgements: I am the Lord. The blood shall be a sign for you, upon&nbsp; the houses where you are; and when I see the blood, &nbsp;I&nbsp; will pass over you, and no plague shall&nbsp; fall upon&nbsp; you&nbsp; to destroy you, when I strike the land of Egypt. &ldquo;This day shall be for you a memorial day, and you shall keep it as a feast to the LORD; throughout your generations you shall observe it as an ordinance for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<em>He loved them to the end.</em></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to John&nbsp;(John 13: 1-15)</span></p>

<p>Before the feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. And during supper, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon&rsquo;s son, to betray him, Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going to God, rose from supper, laid aside his garments, and tied a towel around himself. Then he poured water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples feet, and to wipe them with the towel that was tied around him. He came to Simon Peter; and Peter said to him, &ldquo;Lord, do you wash my feet?&rdquo; Jesus answered him, &ldquo;What I am doing you do not know now, but afterward you will understand.&rdquo; Peter said to him, &ldquo;You shall never wash my feet.&rdquo; Jesus answered him, &ldquo;If I do not wash you, you have no part in me.&rdquo; Simon Peter said to him, &ldquo;Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;He who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but he is clean all over; and you are clean, but not all of you.&rdquo; For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, &ldquo;You are not all clean.&rdquo; When he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and resumed his place, he said to them, &ldquo;Do you know what I have done to you? You call me Teacher and Lord; and you are right, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another&rsquo;s feet. For I have given you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />
<p><span style="color:#ff0000">After the proclamation of the Gospel, the Priest gives a homily in which light is shed on the principal mysteries that are commemorated in this Mass, namely, the institution of the Holy Eucharist and of the priestly Order, and the commandment of the Lord concerning fraternal charity.</span></p>

<p>THE WASHING OF FEET</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">After the Homily, where a pastoral reason suggests it, the Washing of Feet follows. The men who have been chosen are led by the ministers to seats prepared in a suitable place. Then the Priest (removing his chasuble if necessary) goes to each one, and, with the help of the ministers, pours water over each one&rsquo;s feet and then dries them.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#ff0000"><span style="font-size:12px">The celebration of the Lord&rsquo;s passion takes place about three o&rsquo;clock, unless pastoral reasons suggest a later hour. The celebration consists of three parts, namely Liturgy of the Word, the Adoration of the Cross, and Holy Communion. Good Friday of the Lord&rsquo;s Passion is a day of penance for the whole Church, to be marked by fasting and abstinence from meat. No mass is celebrated that day. Today, Good Friday, and if possible, on Holy Saturday Until the Easter Vigil, the paschal fast is observed everywhere to honour the suffering and death of the Lord Jesus, and to prepare ourselves to share more deeply in His resurrection.<br />
The priest , wearing red vestment as for mass, go to the altar in silence and, after making a reverence to the altar, prostrate or if appropriate, kneel and pray in silence for a while. All others kneel. Then the priest, with the ministers, goes to the chair where, facing the people, who are standing, he says, with hands extended, omitting the invitation.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><br />

<em>He was wounded for our transgressions.&rdquo; Fourth song of the Servant of the Lord</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Isaiah&nbsp;Isaiah (52: 13-53: 12)</span><br />
Behold, my servant shall prosper, he shall be exalted and lifted up,and shall be very high. As many were astonished at him his appearance was so marred, beyond human semblance, and his form beyond that of the sons of men &mdash; so shall he startle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths because of him; for that which has not been told them they shall see, and that which they have not heard they shall understand. Who has believed what we have heard? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? For he grew up before him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground; he had no form or comeliness that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, struck down by God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that made us whole, and with his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth. By oppression and judgement he was taken away; and as for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my people? And they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death, although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth. Yet it was the will of the Lord to bruise him; he has put him to grief; when he makes himself an offering for sin, he shall see his offspring, he shall prolong his days; the will of the Lord shall prosper in his hand; he shall see the fruit of the travail of his soul and be satisfied; by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant, make many to be accounted righteous and he shall bear their iniquities. Therefore I will divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he poured out his soul to death, and was numbered with the transgressors; yet he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</p>

<em>He learned obedience and became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Letter to the Hebrews</span><br />
Brethren: Since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. For we have not a high priest who is unable to sympathise with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sinning. Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him from death, and he was heard for his godly fear. Although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered; and being made perfect he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him.</p>

<p><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">N.</span> At that time: Jesus went forth with his disciples across the Kidron valley, where there was a garden, which he and his disciples entered. Now Judas, who betrayed&nbsp; him,&nbsp; also&nbsp; knew the place; for Jesus often met there with his disciples. So Judas, procuring a band of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, went there with lanterns and torches and weapons. Then Jesus, knowing all that was to befall him, came forward and said to them,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+</span>&nbsp; &ldquo;Whom do you seek?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N &nbsp;</span>They answered him,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S&nbsp;</span> &ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span> Jesus said to them,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I am he.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ffa07a">N.</span>&nbsp;Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them. When he said to them, &ldquo;I am he,&rdquo; they drew back and fell to the ground. Again he asked them,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+ &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Whom do you seek?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; And they said,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus answered,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+ </span>&nbsp; &ldquo;I told you that I am he; so if you seek &nbsp;me, let these men go.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">&nbsp;N.</span> This was to fulfill the word which he had spoken, &ldquo;Of those whom you gave me I lost not one.&rdquo; Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest&rsquo;s slave and cut off his right ear. The slave&rsquo;s name was Malchus. Jesus said to Peter,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+</span> &ldquo;Put your sword&nbsp; into&nbsp; its&nbsp; sheath;&nbsp; shall&nbsp; I not&nbsp; drink the chalice which the Father has given me?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span>. So the band of soldiers and their captain and the officers of the Jews seized Jesus and bound him. First they led him to Annas; for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. It was Caiaphas who had given counsel to the Jew that it was expedient that one man should die for the people. Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. As this disciple was known to the high priest, he entered the court of the high priest along with Jesus, while Peter stood outside at the door. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the maid who kept the door, and brought Peter in. The maid who kept the door said to Peter,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span> &ldquo;Are not you also one of this man&rsquo;s disciples?&rdquo; He said,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S</span> &ldquo;I am not.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span> Now the servants and officers had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were standing and warming themselves; Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself. The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.&nbsp; Jesus answered him,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+</span> &ldquo;I have spoken openly to the world; I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all Jews come together; I have said nothing secretly. Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me, what I said to them; they know what I said.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N.</span> When he had said this, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand,&nbsp; saying,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S.</span> &ldquo;Is that how you answer the high priest?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span> Jesus answered him,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+</span> &ldquo;If I have spoken wrongly, bear witness to the wrong; but if I have&nbsp; spoken rightly, why&nbsp; do you&nbsp; strike me?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N.</span> Annas then sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest. Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said to him,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S</span> &ldquo;Are not you also one of his disciples?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span> He denied it and said,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S </span>&ldquo;I am not.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span> One of the servants of the high priest, a kinsman of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S</span> &ldquo;Did I not see you in the&nbsp; garden with him?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span> Peter again denied it; and at once the cock crowed.<br />
Then they led Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the praetorium. It was early. They themselves did not enter the praetorium, so that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.&nbsp; So Pilate went out to them and said;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S</span> &ldquo;What accusation do you bring against this man?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span> They answered him,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S.</span> &ldquo;If &nbsp;this man were not an evildoer, we would not have handed him over.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span> Pilate said to them,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S</span>. &ldquo;Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span> The Jews said to him,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S</span>.&nbsp;&ldquo;It is not lawful for us to put any man to death.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span> This was to fulfill the word which Jesus had spoken to show by what death he was to die. Pilate entered the praetorium again and called Jesus, and said to him,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S</span> &ldquo;Are you the King of the Jews?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span> Jesus answered,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+ </span>&ldquo;Do you say this of your own accord, or did others say it to you about me?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N.</span> Pilate answered,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S</span>. &ldquo;Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me; what have you done?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N.</span> Jesus answered,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;My kingship is not of this world; if my kingship were of this world, my servants would fight, that I might not be handed over to the Jews; but my kingship is not from the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span> Pilate said to him,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S</span>. &ldquo;So you are a king?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span> Jesus answered,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+</span> &ldquo;You say that I am a king. For this I was born, and for this I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span> &nbsp;Pilate said to him,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S</span>. &ldquo;What is truth?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;After he had said this, he went out to the Jews again, and told them,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S </span>&nbsp;&ldquo;I find no crime in him. But you have a custom that I should release one man for you at the Passover; will you have me release for you the King of the Jews?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span> They cried out again,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S</span> &ldquo;Not this man, but Barabbas!</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span> Now Barabbas was a robber.<br />
&nbsp;Then Pilate took Jesus and scourged him. And the soldiers plaited a crown of thorns,and put it on his head, and clothed him in a purple robe; &nbsp;they came up to him, saying,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S</span> Hail, King of the Jews !</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span> and struck him with their hands. Pilate went out again, and said to them,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S</span> Behold, I am bringing him out to you, that you may know that I find no crime in him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span> So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Pilate said to them,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S</span> &ldquo;Here is the man!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N.</span> When the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S</span> &ldquo;Crucify him, crucify him!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span> Pilate said to them,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S</span> &ldquo;Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no crime in him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N </span>The Jews answered him,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S</span> &ldquo;We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he has made himself the Son of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span> When Pilate heard these words, he was even more afraid; he entered the praetorium again and said to Jesus,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S</span> &ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span> But Jesus gave no answer. Pilate therefore said to him,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S</span> &ldquo;You will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, and power to crucify you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span> Jesus answered him,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+</span> &ldquo;You would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above; therefore he who delivered me to you has the greater sin.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span> Upon this Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S</span> &ldquo;If you release this man, you are not Caesar&rsquo;s friend; every one who makes himself a king sets himself against Caesar.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N </span>When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgement seat at a place called The Pavement, and in Hebrew, Gabbatha. Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S</span> &ldquo;Here is your King!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span> They cried out,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S</span> &ldquo;Away with him, away with him, crucify him!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span> Pilate said to them,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S</span> &ldquo;Shall I crucify your King?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N.&nbsp;</span>The chief priests answered,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S.&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;We have no king but Caesar.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span>. Then he handed him over to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus, and he went out, bearing his own cross, to the place called the place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew Golgotha. There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them. Pilate also wrote a title and put it on the cross; it read, &ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.&rdquo; Many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek. The chief priests of the Jews then said to Pilate,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S</span> &ldquo;Do not write, &lsquo;The King of the Jews,&rsquo; but, &lsquo;This man said, I am King of the Jews.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span>.&nbsp;Pilate answered,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S.</span> &ldquo;What I have written I have written.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N.</span> When the soldiers had crucified Jesus they took his garments and made four parts, one for each soldier; also his tunic. But the tunic was without seam, woven from top to bottom; so they said to one another,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">S </span>&ldquo;Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be.&rdquo; This was to fulfill the Scripture, &ldquo;They parted my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots.&rdquo; So the soldiers did this. But standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother&rsquo;s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing near, he said to his mother,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+ </span>&ldquo;Woman, behold, your son!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">&nbsp;N</span> Then he said to the disciple,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">&nbsp;+&nbsp;</span> &nbsp; &ldquo;Behold, your mother!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N. </span>And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home. After this Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (to fulfil the Scripture),</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I thirst.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span> A bowl full of vinegar stood there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth. When Jesus had received the vinegar,&nbsp; he said,</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">+</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;It is finished;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">N</span>.and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">All kneel and pause for a moment in prayer.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Since it was the day of Preparation, in order to prevent the bodies from remaining on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jew asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with him; but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water. He who saw it has borne witness his testimony is true, and he knows that he tells the truth that you also may believe. For these things took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled, &lsquo;&rsquo;Not a bone of him shall be broken.&rsquo; And again another Scripture says, &lsquo;They shall look on him whom they have pierced.&rsquo; After this Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him leave. So he came and took away his body. Nicodemus also, who had at first come to him by night, came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds&rsquo; weight. They took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews. Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb where no one had ever been laid. So because of the Jewish day of Preparation, as the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>SECOND PART<br />
THE ADORATION OF THE HOLY CROSS</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11px"><span style="color:#ff0000">Accompanied by two ministers with lighted candles, the Priest or the Deacon carries the Cross to the entrance of the sanctuary or to another suitable place and there puts it down or hands it over to the ministers to hold. Candles are placed on the right and left sides of the Cross.</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size:11px"><span style="color:#ff0000">For the Adoration of the Cross, first the Priest Celebrant alone approaches, with the chasuble and his shoes removed, if appropriate. Then the clergy, the lay ministers, and the faithful approach, moving as if in procession, and showing reverence to the Cross by a simple genuflection or by some other sign appropriate to the usage of the region, for example, by kissing the Cross.</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size:11px"><span style="color:#ff0000">Only one Cross should be offered for adoration. If, because of the large number of people, it is not possible for all to approach individually, the Priest, after some of the clergy and faithful have adored, takes the Cross and, standing in the middle before the altar, invites the people in a few words to adore the Holy Cross and afterwards holds the Cross elevated higher for a brief time, for the faithful to adore it in silence.</span></span></p>

Meanwhile the Deacon or, if there is no Deacon, the Priest himself, putting on a humeral veil, brings the Blessed Sacrament back from the place of repose to the altar by a shorter route, while all stand in silence. Two ministers with lighted candles accompany the Blessed Sacrament and place their candlesticks around or upon the altar. When the Deacon, if a Deacon is present, has placed the Blessed Sacrament upon the altar and uncovered the ciborium, the Priest goes to the altar, genuflects and continues&hellip;&hellip;.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>HOLY SATURDAY</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#ff0000"><span style="font-size:12px">On Holy Saturday, the Church waits at the Lord&rsquo;s tomb in prayer and fasting, meditating on his Passion and Death and on his Descent into Hell, and awaiting his Resurrection. The Church abstains from the sacrifice of the Mass, with the sacred table left bare, until after the solemn Vigil, that is, the anticipation by night of the Resurrection, when the time comes for paschal joy, the abundance of which overflows to occupy fifty days.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12px"><span style="color:#ff0000"><strong>Easter Time</strong><br />
Liturgical Introduction<br />
Easter Time opens with the solemn celebration of the Easter Vigil and ends on Pentecost Sunday. This time, which lasts fifty days, leads the faithful to a deeper understanding and experience of the presence of the Risen Lord in their midst. The Resurrection of the Lord is the foundation of our Christian faith and that is why the Church offers us the opportunity to reflect and pray about it for such a long time.<br />
Our learning of the Word of God leads us to develop some inner attitudes during the season of Easter. During Eastertide we also take seriously our call to be witnesses of the Risen Lord. The encounter with the Risen Lord dispelled doubts, fears and incredulity of the apostles. Empowered by the Spirit they were able to be true witnesses of the Lord and, through their life and ministry, they brought the Gospel to the ends of the earth.</span></span></p>

Be glad, let earth be glad, as glory floods her,<br />

knowing an end to gloom and darkness.<br />

(Therefore, dearest friends,<br />
standing in the awesome glory of this holy light,<br />
invoke with me, I ask you, the mercy of God almighty,<br />
that he, who has been pleased to number me,<br />
though unworthy, among the Levites,<br />

Who for our sake paid Adam&rsquo;s debt to the eternal Father, and, pouring out his own dear Blood,<br />

banished the darkness of sin.<br />
This is the night<br />
that even now, throughout the world,<br />
sets Christian believers apart from worldly vices and from the gloom of sin, leading them to grace, and joining them to his holy ones.<br />
This is the night,<br />

yet never dimmed by sharing of its light, for it is fed by melting wax,<br />
drawn out by mother bees to build a torch so precious.<br />
O truly blessed night,<br />

Therefore, O Lord, we pray you that this candle,<br />
hallowed to the honour of your name, may persevere undimmed,<br />

<p style="text-align:center">THE LITURGY OF THE WORD</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#ff0000"><span style="font-size:12px">In this Vigil, the mother of all Vigils, nine readings are provided, namely seven from the Old Testament and two from the New (the Epistle and Gospel), all of which should be read whenever this can be done, so that the character of the Vigil, which demands an extended period of time, may be preserved. Nevertheless, where more serious pastoral circumstances demand it, the number of readings from the Old Testament may be reduced,</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">FIRST READING </span></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Genesis (Genesis 1;1-2:2)</span></p>

<p>*in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.<span style="color:#ff0000">*</span> the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the Spirit of God was moving over the face of the waters. And God said, &ldquo;let there be light&rdquo;; and there was light. And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day. And God said, &ldquo;let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.&rdquo; And God made the firmament and separated the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament. And it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day. And God said, &ldquo;let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.&rdquo; And it was so. God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good. And God said, &ldquo;let the earth put forth vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, upon the earth.&rdquo; And it was so. The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, a third day. And God said, &ldquo;Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to separate the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years, and let them be lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth.&rdquo; And it was so. And God made the two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; he made the stars also. And God set them in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth, to rule over the day and over the night, and&nbsp; to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day. And God said, &ldquo;Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the firmament of the heavens.&rdquo; So God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. And God blessed them, saying, &ldquo;Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.&rdquo; And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day. And God said, &ldquo;Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds: cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.&rdquo; And it was so. And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the cattle according to their kinds, and everything that creeps upon the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. Then God said, &ldquo;Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. And God blessed them, and God said to them, &ldquo;Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth. And God said, &ldquo;Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food. And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food. And it was so. And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good.<span style="color:#ff0000">*</span> And there was evening and there was morning, a sixth day. Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">* </span>In those days: God tested Abraham, and said to him, &ldquo;Abraham!&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Here am I.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Take your son, your only-begotten son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering upon one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.&rdquo;<span style="color:#ff0000">*</span> Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac; and he cut the wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him. On the third day Abraham lifted up his&nbsp; eyes and saw the place afar off. Then Abraham said to his young men, &ldquo;Stay here with the donkey; I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.&rdquo; And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it on Isaac his son; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So they went both of them together. And Isaac said to his father Abraham, &ldquo;My father!&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Here am I, my son.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Behold, the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?&rdquo; Abraham said, God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.&rdquo; So they went both of them together. When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood. Then Abraham put forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. But the angel of the Lord called to him from heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham! &rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Here am I. He said, Do not lay your hand on the lad or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only-begotten son, from me.&rdquo; And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns; and Abraham went&nbsp; and took the ram,&nbsp; and offered&nbsp; it up&nbsp; as a burnt offering instead of his son.<span style="color:#ff0000">*</span></p>

<p>So Abraham called the name of that place the Lord will provide; as it is said to this day, On the mount of the Lord it shall be provided.<br />
And the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven, and said, By myself I have sworn, says the Lord, because you have done this, and have not withheld your son, your only-begotten son, I will indeed bless you, and I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is on the seashore. And your descendants shall possess the gate of their enemies, and by your descendants shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves, because you have obeyed my voice.</p>

<p><em>The sons of Israel walked on dry ground through the sea.</em></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Exodus(Exodus 14:15-15:1)</span></p>

<p>In those days: The Lord said to Moses, Why do you cry to me? Tell the sons of Israel to go forward. Lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, that the sons of Israel may go on dry ground through the sea. And I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they shall go in after them, and I will get glory over Pharaoh and all his host, his chariots, and his horsemen. And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I have gotten glory over Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.&rdquo; Then the angel of God who went before the host of Israel moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them, coming between the host of Egypt and the host of Israel. And there was the cloud and the darkness; and the night passed without one coming near the other all night. Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord drove the sea back by a strong east wind all night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. And the sons of Israel went into the midst of the sea on dry ground, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left. The Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh&#39;s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. And in the morning watch the Lord in the pillar of fire and of cloud looked down upon the host&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Egyptians, and discomfited the host of the Egyptians, clogging their chariot wheels so that they drove heavily; and the Egyptians said, Let us flee from before Israel; for the Lord fights for them against the Egyptians.&rdquo; Then the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the water may come back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.&rdquo; So Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its usual flow when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled into it, and the Lord routed the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. The waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen and all the host of Pharaoh that had followed them into the sea; not so much as one of them remained. But the sons of Israel walked on dry ground through the sea, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left. Thus the Lord saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore. And Israel saw the great work which the Lord did against the Egyptians, and the people feared the Lord; and they believed in the Lord and in his servant Moses. Then Moses and the sons of Israel sang this song to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;I will sing to the Lord, for he has triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea.</p>

<p>Your Maker is your husband, the Lord of hosts is his name; and the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer, the God of the whole earth he is called. For the Lord has called you like a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit, like a wife of youth when she is cast off, says your God. For a brief moment I forsook you, but with great compassion I will gather you. In overflowing wrath for a moment I hid my face from you, but with everlasting mercy I will have compassion on you, says the Lord, your Redeemer. For this is like the days of Noah to me: I swore that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth, so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you and will not rebuke you. For the mountains may depart and the hills be removed, but my mercy shall not depart from you, and my covenant of peace shall not be removed, says the Lord, who has compassion on you. O afflicted one, storm-tossed, and not comforted, behold, I will set your stones in antimony, and lay your foundations with sapphires. I will make your pinnacles of agate, your gates of carbuncles, and all your wall of precious stones. All your sons shall be taught by the Lord, and great shall be the prosperity of your sons.

Incline your ear, and come to me; hear, that your soul may live; and I will make with you an everlasting covenant, my steadfast, merciful love for David. Behold, I made him a witness to the peoples, a leader and commander for the peoples. Behold, you shall call nations that you know not, and nations that knew you not shall run to you, because of the Lord your God, and of the Holy One of Israel, for he has glorified you. Seek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near; let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; let him return to the Lord, that he may have mercy on him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, says the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts. &ldquo;For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return there but water the earth, making it bring forth and sprout, giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater, so shall my word be that goes forth from my mouth; it shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I intend, and prosper in the thing for which I sent it.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Baruch (Baruch 3:9-15.32-4:4)</span></p>

<p>Hear the commandments of life, O Israel; give ear, and learn wisdom! Why is it, O Israel, why is it that you are in the land of your enemies, that you are growing old in a foreign country, that you are defiled with the dead, that you are counted among those in Hades? You have forsaken the fountain of wisdom. If you had walked in the way of God, you would be dwelling in peace for ever. Learn where there is wisdom, where there is strength, where there is understanding, that you may at the same time discern where there is length of days, and life, where there is light for the eyes, and peace. Who has found her place? And who has entered her storehouses? But he who knows all things knows her, he found her by his understanding. He who prepared the earth for all time filled it with four-footed creatures; he who sends forth the light, and it goes, called it, and it obeyed him in fear; the stars shone in their watches, and were glad; he called them, and they said, Here we are ! They shone with gladness for him who made them. This is our God; no other can be compared to him! He found the whole way to knowledge, and gave her to Jacob his servant and to Israel whom he loved. Afterwards she appeared upon earth and lived among men. She is the book of the commandments of God, and the law that endures for ever. All who hold her fast will live, and those who forsake her will die. Turn, O Jacob, and take her; walk towards the shining of her light. Do not give your glory to another, or your advantages to an alien people. Happy are we, O Israel, for we know what is pleasing to God.</p>

But when they came to the nations, wherever they came, they profaned my holy name, in that men said of them, These are the people of the Lord, and yet they had to go out of his land. But I had concern for my holy name, which the house of Israel caused to be profaned among the nations to which they came. Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord God: It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations to which you came. And I will vindicate the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned among them; and the nations will know that I am the Lord, says the Lord GOD, when through you I vindicate my holiness before their eyes. For I will take you from the nations, and gather you from all the countries, and bring you into your own land. I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you. A new heart I will give you, and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will take out of your flesh the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to observe my ordinances. You shall dwell in the land which I gave to your fathers; and you shall be my people, and I will be your God.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Romans (Romans 6 :3-11)</span></p>

<p>Brethren: All of us who have been baptised into Christ Jesus were baptised into his death. We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. We know that our former man was crucified with him so that the sinful body might be destroyed, and we might no longer be enslaved to sin. For he who has died is freed from sin. But if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him. For we know that Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. The death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>After the sabbath, towards the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb. And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone, and sat upon it. His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. And for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men. But the angel said to the women, Do not be afraid; for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. He is not here; for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay. Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and behold, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him. Behold, I have told you. So they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples. And behold, Jesus met them and said, Hail! And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshipped him. Then Jesus said to them, Do not be afraid; go and tell my brethren to go to Galilee, and there they will see me.</p>

In those days: Peter opened his mouth and said, You know the word which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism which John preached: how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power; how he went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. And we are witnesses to all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree; but God raised him on the third day and made him manifest; not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that he is the one ordained by God to be judge of the living and the dead. To him all the prophets bear witness that every one who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.</p>

On the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb. So she ran, and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him. Peter then came out with the other disciple, and they went towards the tomb. They both ran, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first; and stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in. Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb; he saw the linen cloths lying, and the napkin, which had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths but rolled up in a place by itself. Then the other disciple, who reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed; for as yet they did not know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead.</p>

That very day [the first day&nbsp; of the week], two of the disciples of Jesus were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, and talking with each other about all these things that had happened.

And they said to him, &ldquo;Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty&nbsp; in deed and word before God and all the people, and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since this happened. Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning and did not find his body; and they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. Some of those who were with us went to the tomb, and found it just as the women had said; but him they did not see.&rdquo; And he said to them, &ldquo;O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe all&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; prophets&nbsp; have&nbsp; spoken! Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things&nbsp; and enter into his glory?&rdquo; And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself. So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He appeared to be going further, but they constrained him, saying, &ldquo;Stay with&nbsp; us,&nbsp; for&nbsp; it is towards&nbsp; evening&nbsp; and the&nbsp; day is now far spent.&rdquo; So he went in to stay with them. When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed and broke it, and gave it to them. And their eyes were opened and they recognised him; and he vanished out of their sight. They said to&nbsp; each, other, &ldquo;Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the&nbsp; Scriptures?&rdquo; And they rose&nbsp; &nbsp;that same hour and returned to Jerusalem; and they found the Eleven gathered together and those who were with them, who said, The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon! Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.</p>

<em>This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses.</em></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 2: 14.22-33)</span><br />
[On the day of Pentecost,] Peter, standing with the Eleven, lifted up his voice and addressed them, Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words. Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God&nbsp; with&nbsp; mighty works and wonders and signs which God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know &mdash; this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men. But God raised him up, having loosed the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it. For David says concerning him, I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken; therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; moreover my flesh will dwell in hope. For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, nor let your Holy One see corruption. You have made known to me the ways of life; you will make me full of gladness with your presence. &rsquo; &ldquo;Brethren, I may say to you confidently of the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants upon his throne, he foresaw and spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses. Being therefore exalted at the right hand&nbsp; &nbsp;of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which you see and hear.&rdquo;</p>

At that time: The women departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples. And behold, Jesus met them. and said, &ldquo;Hail!&rdquo; And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshipped him. Then Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Do not be afraid; go and tell my brethren to go to Galilee, and there they will see me.&rdquo; While they were going, behold, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests all that had taken place. And when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel, they gave a sum of money to the soldiers and said, &ldquo;Tell people, &lsquo;His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep And if this comes to the governor&rsquo;s ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.&rdquo; So they took the money and did as they were directed; and this story has been spread among the Jews to this day.</p>

In those days: Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour. And a man lame from birth was being carried, whom they laid daily at that gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask alms of those who entered the temple. Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked for alms. And Peter directed his gaze at him, with John,and said,&nbsp;&ldquo;Look at us.&rdquo; And he fixed his attention upon them, expecting to receive something from them. But Peter said, &ldquo;I have no silver and gold, but I give you what I have; in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise and walk.&rdquo; And he took him by the right hand and raised him up; and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong. And leaping up he stood and walked and entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God. And all the people saw him walking and praising God, and recognised him as the one who sat for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.</p>

That very day, [the first day of the week,] two of the&nbsp; disciples&nbsp; of Jesus were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, and talking with each other about all these things that had happened. While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. But their eyes were kept from recognising him. And he said to them, &ldquo;What is this conversation which you are holding with each other as you walk?&rdquo; And they stood still, looking sad. Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, &ldquo;Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?&rdquo; And he said to them, &ldquo;What things?&rdquo; And they said to him, &ldquo;Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty&nbsp;in deed and word before God and all the people, and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.

You killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 3 : 11-26)</span><br />
In those days: While the lame man who had been cured clung to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the portico called Solomon&rsquo;s, astounded. And when Peter saw it he addressed the people, &ldquo;Men of Israel, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we had made him walk? The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified his servant Jesus, whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release him. But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you, and killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses. And his name, by faith in his name, has made this man strong whom you see and know; and the faith which is through Jesus has given the man this perfect health in the presence of you all. &ldquo;And now, brethren, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers. But what God foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should suffer, he thus fulfilled. Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Christ appointed for you, Jesus, whom heaven must receive until the time for establishing all that God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old. Moses said, &lsquo;The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet from your brethren as he raised me up. You shall listen to him in whatever he tells you. And it shall be that every soul that does not listen to that prophet shall be destroyed from the people. &rsquo; And all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and those who came afterwards, also proclaimed these days. You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God gave to your fathers, saying to Abraham, &lsquo;And in your posterity shall all the families of the earth be blessed. &rsquo; God, having raised up his servant, sent him to you first, to bless you in turning every one of you from your wickedness.&rdquo;</p>

At that time: The two disciples told what had happened on the road to Emmaus and how Jesus was known to them in the breaking of the bread. As they were saying this, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, Peace to you. But they were startled and frightened, and supposed that they saw a spirit. And he said to them, Why are you troubled, and why do questionings rise in your hearts? See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; handle me, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see that I have. And when he had said this he showed them his hands and his feet. And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said to them, Have you anything here to eat? They gave him a piece of broiled fish, and he took it and ate before them. Then he said to them,These are my words which I spoke to you, while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled. Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, and said to them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things.</p>

In those days: As Peter and John were speaking to the people, [after the lame man was healed,] the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them, annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead. And they arrested them and put them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening. But many of those who heard the word believed; and the number &nbsp;of the men came &nbsp;to about five thousand. On the next day their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem, with Annas the high priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all who were of the high-priestly family. And when they had set them in their midst, they inquired, &ldquo;By what power or by what name did you do this?&rdquo; Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, &ldquo;Rulers of the people and elders, if we are being examined today concerning a good deed done to a cripple, by what means this man has been healed, be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by him this man is standing before you well.

<em>Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and so with the fish.</em></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to John (John 21: 1-14)</span><br />
At that time: Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of &nbsp;Tiberias; and he revealed himself in this way. Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together. Simon Peter said to them, &ldquo;I am going fishing.&rdquo; They said to him, &ldquo;We will go with you.&rdquo; They went out and got into the boat; but that night they caught nothing. Just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the beach; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Children, have you any fish?&rdquo; They answered him, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He said to them, &ldquo;Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.&rdquo; So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in, for the quantity of fish. That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, &ldquo;It is the Lord!&rdquo; When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his clothes, for he was stripped for work, and sprang into the sea. But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, but about a hundred yards off. When they got out on land, they saw a charcoal fire there, with fish lying on it, and bread. Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.&rdquo; So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three of them; and although there were so many, the net was not torn. Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Come and have breakfast.&rdquo; Now none of the disciples dared ask him, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; They knew it was the Lord. Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and so with the fish. This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.<br />

<p>FIRST READING<br />
<em>We cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard.</em></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles &nbsp;4:13-21</span><br />
In those days: When the rulers and elders and scribes saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated, common men, they wondered; and they recognised that they had been with Jesus. But seeing the man that had been healed standing beside them, they had nothing to say in opposition. But when they had commanded&nbsp; them to go aside out&nbsp; of the&nbsp; council,&nbsp; they conferred with one another, saying, &ldquo;What shall we do with these men? For that a notable sign has been performed through them is manifest to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it. But in order that it may spread no further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more to any one in this name.&rdquo; So they called them and charged them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus. But Peter and John answered them, &ldquo;Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge; for we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard.&rdquo; And when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people; for all men praised God for what had happened.</p>

<em>Go into all the world and preach the Gospel.</em></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark (Mark 16:&#39;9- 15)</span><br />
When Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons. She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept. But when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they would not believe it. After this he appeared in another form to two of them, as they were&nbsp; walking&nbsp; into the country. And they went back and told the rest, but they did not believe them. Afterwards he appeared to the Eleven themselves&nbsp; as they sat at table; and he upbraided them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen. And he said to them, &ldquo;Go into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation.&rdquo;</p>

<em>All who believed were together and had all things in common.</em></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 2:42-47)</span><br />
[The brethren] held steadfastly to the apostles teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of the bread and to the prayers. And fear came upon every soul; and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles. And all who believed were together and had all things in common; and they sold their possessions and goods and distributed them to all, as any had need. And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they partook of food with glad and generous hearts, praising God and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.</p>

In this you rejoice, though now for a little while you may have to suffer various trials, so that the genuineness of your faith, more precious than gold which though perishable is tested by fire, may redound to praise and glory and honour at the revelation of Jesus Christ.

<em>Eight days later Jesus came.</em></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">* A reading from the holy Gospel according to John (John 20: 19-3 I)</span><br />
On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, &ldquo;Peace be with you.&rdquo; When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again, &ldquo;Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you.&rdquo; And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit. If you&nbsp; forgive the&nbsp; sins&nbsp; of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.&rdquo; Now Thomas, one of the Twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came. So the other&nbsp; disciples told him,&nbsp; &ldquo;We have seen the Lord.&rdquo; But he said to them, &ldquo;Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and place my finger in the mark of the nails, and place my hand in his side, I will not believe.&rdquo; Eight days later, his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. The doors were shut, but Jesus came and stood among them, and said, &ldquo;Peace be with you.&rdquo; Then he said to Thomas, &ldquo;Put your finger here, and see my hands; and&nbsp; put&nbsp; out your&nbsp; hand, and place it in my side; do not be faithless, but believing.&rdquo; Thomas answered him, &ldquo;My Lord and my God!&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;You have believed because you have seen me. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe.&rdquo; Now Jesus did many other&nbsp;&nbsp; signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book; but these are written that you may believe that Jesus&nbsp; is the Christ, the&nbsp; Son of God, and that believing&nbsp; you&nbsp; may have&nbsp; life in his&nbsp; name.</p>

In those days: when Peter and John were released they went to their friends and reported what the chief priests and the elders had said to them. And when they heard it, they lifted their voices together to God and said, &ldquo;Sovereign Lord, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them, who by the mouth of our father David, your servant, said by the Holy Spirit, &lsquo;why did the Gentiles rage, and the peoples imagine vain things? The kings of the earth set themselves in array, and the rulers were gathered together, against the Lord and against his Anointed&rsquo; &ndash;for truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place. And now, Lord, look upon their threats, and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness, while you stretch out your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your Holy servant Jesus.&rdquo; And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God with boldness.</p>

Can he enter a second time into his mother&rsquo;s womb and be born?&rdquo; Jesus answered, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.

The company of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had everything in common. And with great power the apostles gave their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all. There was not any one needy among them, for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of what was sold and laid it at the apostles feet; and distribution was made to each as any had need. Thus Joseph who was surnamed by the apostles Barnabas (which means, Son of encouragement), a Levite, a native of Cyprus, sold a field which belonged to him, and brought the money&nbsp; and laid it at the apostles&rsquo; feet.</p>

Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and bear witness to what we have seen; but you do not receive our testimony. If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things? No one has ascended into heaven but he who descended from heaven, the Son of man.

In those days: The high priest rose up and all who were with him, that is, the party of the Sadducees, and filled with jealousy they arrested the apostles and put them in the common prison. But at night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out and said, &ldquo;Go and stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this Life.&rdquo; And when they heard this, they entered the temple at daybreak and taught. Now the high priest came and those who were with him and called together the council and all the senate of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought. But when the officers came, they did not find them in the prison, and they returned and reported, &ldquo;We found the prison securely locked and the sentries standing at the doors, but when we opened it we found no one inside.&rdquo; Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were much perplexed about them, wondering what this would come to. And some one came and told them, &ldquo;The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.&rdquo; Then the captain with the officers went and brought them, but without violence, for they were afraid of being stoned by the people.</p>

Jesus said to Nicodemus,God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God sent the Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him. He who believes in him is not condemned; he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God. And this is the judgement, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. But he who does what is true comes to the light, that it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been wrought in God.&rdquo;</p>

<em>We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit.</em></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles Acts (Acts 5:27-33)</span><br />
In those days: When the officers had brought the apostles, they set them before the council. And the high priest questioned them, saying, &ldquo;We strictly charged you not to teach in this name, yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and you intend to bring this man&rsquo;s blood upon us.&rdquo; But Peter and the apostles answered, &ldquo;We must obey God rather than men. The God of our fathers raised Jesus whom you killed by hanging him on a tree. God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Saviour, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. And we are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him.&rdquo; When they heard this they were enraged and wanted to kill them.</p>

<em>The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.</em></p>

Jesus said to Nicodemus, &ldquo;He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the earth belongs to the earth, and of the earth he speaks; he who comes from heaven is above&nbsp; all. He bears&nbsp; witness&nbsp; to what he has seen and heard, yet no one receives his testimony; he who receives his testimony sets his seal to this, that God is true. For he whom God has sent utters the words of God, for it is not by measure that he gives the Spirit; the Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand. He who believes in the Son has eternal life; he who does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God rests upon him.&rdquo;</p>

<em>They left rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name.</em></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles Acts 5 :34-42)</span><br />
In those days: A Pharisee in the council named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, held in honour by all the people, stood up and ordered the apostles to be put outside for a while. And he said to them, &ldquo;Men of Israel, take care what you do with these men. For before these days Theudas arose, claiming to be somebody, and a number of men, about four hundred, joined him; but he was slain and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing. After him Judas the Galilean arose in the days of the census and drew away some of the people after him; he also perished, and all who followed him were scattered. So in the present case I tell you, keep away from these men and let them alone; for if this plan or this undertaking is of men, it will fail; but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them. You might even be found opposing God!&rdquo; So they took his advice, and when they had called in the apostles, they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. Then they left the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonour for the name. And every day in the temple and at home they did not cease teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ.</p>

At that time: Jesus went to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias. And a multitude followed him, because they saw the signs which he did on those who were diseased. Jesus went up into the hills, and there sat down with his disciples. Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand. Lifting&nbsp; &nbsp;up his eyes, then, and seeing that a multitude was coming to him, Jesus said to Philip, &ldquo;How are we to buy bread, so that these people may eat?&rdquo; This he said to test him, for he himself knew what he would do. Philip answered him, &ldquo;Two hundred denarii would not buy enough bread for each of them to get a little.&rdquo; One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter&rsquo;s brother, said to him, &ldquo;There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two fish; but what are they among so many?&rdquo; Jesus said, &ldquo;Make the people sit down.&rdquo; Now there was much grass in the place; so the men sat down, in number about five thousand. Jesus then took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed them to those who were seated; so also the fish, as much as they wanted. And when they had eaten their fill, he told his disciples, &ldquo;Gather up the fragments left over, that nothing may be lost.&rdquo; So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves, left by those who had eaten. When the people saw the sign which he had done, they said, &ldquo;This is indeed the prophet who is to come into the world!&rdquo; Perceiving then that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, Jesus withdrew again to the hills by himself.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 6: 1-7)</span><br />
In these days when the disciples were increasing in number, the Hellenists murmured against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily distribution. And the Twelve summoned the body of the disciples and said, &ldquo;It is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables. Therefore, brethren, pick out from among you seven men of good &nbsp;repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint to this duty. But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.&rdquo; And what they said pleased the whole multitude, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch. These they set before the apostles, and they prayed and laid their hands upon them. And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests were obedient to the faith.</p>

The sea rose because a strong wind was blowing. When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near&nbsp; to the boat. They were frightened, but he said to them, &ldquo;It is I; do not be afraid.&rdquo; Then they were glad to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.</p>

<p>FIRST READING<br />
<em>It was not possible for him to be held by death.</em></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 2:14.22-33)</span><br />
[On the day of Pentecost,] Peter, standing with the Eleven, lifted up his voice and said, &ldquo;Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you and give ear to my words. &ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs which God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know &mdash; this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men. But God raised him up, having loosed the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it. For David says concerning him, &lsquo;I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken; therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; moreover my flesh will dwell in hope. For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, nor let your Holy One see corruption. You have made known to me the ways of life; you will make me full of gladness with your presence. &rdquo;&rsquo; &ldquo;Brethren, I may say to you confidently of the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants upon his throne, he foresaw and spoke of&nbsp; the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. This Jesus God raised up, and of that we are all witnesses. Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which you see and hear.&rdquo;</p>

<em>They recognised him in the breaking of the bread</em>.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke (Luke 24: 13-35)</span><br />
That very day [the first day of the week],&nbsp; two&nbsp; of the&nbsp; disciples&nbsp; of Jesus were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, and talking with each other about all these things that had happened. While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. But their eyes were kept from recognising him. And he said to them, &ldquo;What is this conversation which you are holding with each other as you walk?&rdquo; And they stood still, looking sad. Then one of &nbsp;them, named Cleopas, answered him, &ldquo;Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?&rdquo; And he said to them, &ldquo;What things?&rdquo; And they said to him, &ldquo;Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty&nbsp; in deed and word before God and all the people, and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since this happened. Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning and did not find his body; and they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. Some of those who were with us went to the tomb, and found it just as the women had said; but him they did not see.&rdquo; And he said to them, &ldquo;O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe all that&nbsp; the&nbsp; prophets&nbsp; have&nbsp; spoken! Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things&nbsp; and enter into his glory?&rdquo; And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself. So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He appeared to be going further, but they constrained him, saying, &ldquo;Stay with&nbsp; us,&nbsp; for&nbsp; it is towards&nbsp; evening&nbsp; and the&nbsp; day is now far spent.&rdquo; So he went in to stay with them. When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed and broke it, and gave it to them. And their eyes were opened and they recognised him; and he vanished out of their sight. They said to&nbsp; each, other, &ldquo;Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the&nbsp; Scriptures?&rdquo; And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem; and they found the Eleven gathered together and those who were with them, who said, &ldquo;The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!&rdquo; Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.</p>

Then some of those who belonged&nbsp; to the synagogue of the Freedmen &nbsp;(as it was called), and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and Asia, arose and disputed with Stephen. But they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke. Then they secretly instigated men, who said, &ldquo;We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.&rdquo; And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and they came upon him and seized him and brought him before the council, and set up false witnesses who said, &ldquo;This man never ceases to speak words against this holy place and the law; for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us.&rdquo; And gazing at him, all who sat in the council saw that his face was like the face of an angel.</p>

[After five thousand men had eaten their fill, the disciples of Jesus saw him walking on the sea.] On the next day the people who remained on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone. However, boats from Tiberias came near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks. So when the people saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats and went to Capernaum, seeking Jesus. When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, &ldquo;Rabbi, when did you come here?&rdquo; Jesus answered them, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves. Do not labour for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to eternal life, which the Son of man will give to you; for on him has God the Father set his seal.&rdquo; Then they said to him, &ldquo;What must we do, to be doing the works of God?&rdquo; Jesus answered them, &ldquo;This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>FIRST READING<br />
<em>Fill the earth and subdue it.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Genesis (Genesis I :26-2:3)</span><br />
God said, Let us make man &nbsp;in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.&rdquo; So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. And God blessed them, and God said to them, &ldquo;Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.&rdquo; And God said, &ldquo;Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food. And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.&rdquo; And it was so. And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, a sixth day. Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done. So God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because on it God rested from all his work which he had done in creation.</p>

At that time: Coming to his own country, Jesus taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, &ldquo;Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty&nbsp; works?&nbsp; Is not this the carpenter&rsquo;s son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not his brethren James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? And are not all his sisters with us? Where then Mary? And are not his brethren James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all this?&rdquo; And they took offence at him. But Jesus said to them, &ldquo;A prophet is not without honour except in his own country and in his own house.&rdquo; And he did not do many mighty works there, because of their unbelief.</p>

In those days: Stephen said to the people and the elders and the scribes, &ldquo;You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised &nbsp;in heart&nbsp; and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit. As your fathers did, so do you. Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? And they killed those who announced &nbsp;beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered, you who received the law as delivered by angels and did not keep it.&rdquo; Now when they heard these things they were enraged, and they ground their teeth against him. But he, full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God; and he said, &ldquo;Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God.&rdquo; But they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and rushed together upon him. Then they cast him out of the city and stoned him; and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul. And as they were stoning Stephen, he prayed, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.&rdquo; And when he had said this, he fell asleep. And Saul was consenting to his death.</p>

SS PHILIP AND JAMES, AP. (FEAST)</p>

<p>Today the Church celebrates the feast of two apostles, Philip and James. Their relics are kept together in the Church of the Twelve Apostles in Rome and, from the day of its dedication in 565, these two apostles have been celebrated together. Philip came from Bethsaida, on the shore of the Lake of Galilee. He was a disciple of John the Baptist and later became an apostle of Jesus. James, son of Alphaeus and cousin of the Lord, ruled the Church of Jerusalem, and probably authored the letter we find in the New Testament. He suffered martyrdom in the year 62.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Entrance Antiphon</span><br />

<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the first Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians (1 Corinthians 15:1-8)</span><br />
I would remind you, brethren, in what terms I preached to you the gospel, which you received, in which you stand, by which you are saved, if you hold it fast &mdash; unless you believed in vain. For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve. Then he appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. Last of all, as to one untimely born, he&nbsp; appeared&nbsp; also to &nbsp;me.</p>

If you had known me, you would have known my Father also; henceforth you know him and have seen him.&rdquo; Philip said to him, &ldquo;Lord, show us the Father, and we shall be satisfied.&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Have I been with you so long, and yet you do not know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father; how can you say, &lsquo;Show us the Father&rsquo;? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority; but the Father who dwells in me does his works. Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or else believe me for the sake of the works themselves. &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I go to the Father. Whatever you ask in my name, I will do it, that the Father may be glorified in the Son; if you ask anything in my name, I will do it.</p>

<em>See, here is water! What is to prevent my being baptised?</em></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 8:26-40)</span><br />
In those days: An angel of the Lord said to Philip, &ldquo;Rise and go towards the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.&rdquo; This is a desert road. And he rose and went. And behold, an Ethiopian, a eunuch, a minister of Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, in charge of all her treasure, had come to Jerusalem to worship and was returning; seated in his chariot, he was reading the prophet Isaiah. And the Spirit said to Philip, &ldquo;Go up and join this chariot.&rdquo; So Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and asked, &ldquo;Do you understand what you are&nbsp; &nbsp;reading?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;How can I, unless some one guides me?&rdquo; And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. Now the passage&nbsp; of the Scripture which he was reading was this: &ldquo;As a sheep led&nbsp; to the slaughter or a lamb before its shearer is silent, so he opens not his mouth. In his humiliation justice was denied him. Who can describe his generation? For his life is taken up from the earth.&rdquo; And the eunuch said to Philip, &ldquo;Please, about whom does the prophet say this, about himself or about some one else?&rdquo; Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this Scripture he told him the good news of Jesus. And as they went along the road they came to some water, and the eunuch said, &ldquo;See, here is water! What is to prevent my being baptised?&rdquo; And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptised him. And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught up Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his way rejoicing. But Philip was found at Azotus, and passing on he preached the gospel to all the towns till he came to Caesarea.</p>

<em>He is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 9:1-20)</span><br />
In those days: Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. Now as he journeyed he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed about him. And he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, &ldquo;Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Who are you, Lord?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting; but rise and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do.&rdquo; The men who were travelling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one. Saul arose from the ground; and when his eyes were opened, he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. And for three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank. Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, &ldquo;Ananias.&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Here I am, Lord.&rdquo; And the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Rise and go to the street called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for a man of Tarsus named Saul; for behold, he is praying, and he has seen a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.&rdquo; But Ananias answered, &ldquo;Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem; and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call upon your name.&rdquo; But the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Go, for he is a chosen &nbsp;instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel; for I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.&rdquo; So Ananias departed and entered the house. And laying his hands on him he said, &ldquo;Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has sent me that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes and he regained his sight. Then he rose and was baptised, and took food and was strengthened. For several days he was with the disciples at Damascus. And in the synagogues immediately he proclaimed Jesus, saying, &ldquo;He is the Son of God.</p>

In those days: The Church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was built up; and walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit it was multiplied. Now as Peter went here and there among them all, he came&nbsp; down also to the saints that lived at Lydda. There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years and was paralyzed. And Peter said to him, &ldquo;Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you; rise and make your bed.&rdquo; And immediately he rose. And all the residents of Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord. Now there was at Joppa a disciple named Tabitha, which means Dorcas or Gazelle.&nbsp; She was full of good works and acts of charity. In those days she fell&nbsp; sick&nbsp; and&nbsp; died;&nbsp; and&nbsp; when&nbsp; they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room. Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there,&nbsp; sent&nbsp; two men to him entreating him, &ldquo;Please come to us without delay.&rdquo; So Peter rose and went with them. And when he had come, they took him to the upper room. All the widows stood beside him weeping, and showing coats and garments which Dorcas made while she was with them. But Peter put them all outside and knelt down and prayed; then turning to the body he said, &ldquo;Tabitha, rise.&rdquo; And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up. And he gave her his hand and lifted her up. Then calling the saints and widows he presented her alive. And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.</p>

<em>To whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life</em>.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to John (John 6:60-69)</span><br />
At that time: Many of the disciples of Jesus said, &ldquo;This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?&rdquo; But Jesus,&nbsp;knowing&nbsp; in himself&nbsp; that his disciples murmured at it, said to them, &ldquo;Do you take offence at this? Then what if you were to see the Son of man ascending where he was before? It is the spirit that gives life, the flesh is of no avail; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. But there are some of you that do not believe.&rdquo; For Jesus knew from the first who those were that did not believe, and who it was that would betray him. And he said, &ldquo;This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.&rdquo; After this many of his disciples drew back and no longer walked with him. Jesus said to the Twelve, &ldquo;Will you also go away?&rdquo; Simon Peter answered him, &ldquo;Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life; and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy&nbsp; One of God.&rdquo;</p>

GOOD SHEPHERD SUNDAY</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Vocation Sunday:</span><br />
Today, special prayers should be offered for vocations to the priesthood and the religious life. A special homily on the subject should be given to the faithful and prayers for this included in the general intercession.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Entrance Anti &nbsp;Cf ps 33:5-6</span><br />
The merciful love of the Lord fills the earth; by the word of the Lord the heavens were made, alleluia.<br />
The Gloria in excelsis (Glory to God in the highest) is said.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Collect</span><br />
Almighty ever-living God, lead us to a share in the joys of heaven, so that the humble flock may reach where the brave shepherd has gone before. Who lives and reigns with you...</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Sunday:</span> <strong>The Good Shepherd.</strong> A shepherd is a guide and a leader and so the fourth Sunday after Easter is called Vocation Sunday: a day of special prayer for those who are &ldquo;shepherds&rdquo; in the Church. There is only one &ldquo;Shepherd&rdquo; and that is Jesus. We are his flock. Those who belong to his flock recognise his voice. Jesus is also the gate. Those who need to contact his sheep must go through him, must, that is, mould their way of thinking and acting on his. The first and second readings are linked to this theme and show us what Jesus did, which we must imitate.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>FIRST READING </strong><br />
<em>&ldquo;God has made him both Lord and Christ.&rdquo;</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 2.14a.36-41)</span><br />
[On the day of Pentecost,] Peter, standing with the Eleven, lifted up his voice and said to the multitude, &ldquo;Let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.&rdquo; Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, &ldquo;Brethren, what shall we do?&rdquo; And Peter said to them, &ldquo;Repent, and be baptised every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is to you and to your children and to all that are far off, every one whom the Lord our God calls to him.&rdquo; And he testified with many other words and exhorted them, saying, &ldquo;Save yourselves from this crooked generation.&rdquo; So those who received his word were baptised, and there were added that day about three thousand souls.</p>

<p>The word of the Lord.</p>

<p><br />

Fresh and green are the pastures<br />
where he gives me repose.<br />
Near restful waters he leads me;<br />
he revives my soul. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p>He guides me along the right path,<br />
for the sake of his name.<br />
Though I should walk in the valley of the shadow of death,<br />
no evil would I fear, for you are with me.<br />
Your crook and your staff will give me comfort. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p>You have prepared a table before me<br />
in the sight of my foes.<br />
My head you have anointed with oil;<br />
my cup is overflowing. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p>Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me<br />
all the days of my life.<br />
In the Lord&rsquo;s own house shall I dwell<br />

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">SECOND READING</span><br />
<em>You have returned to the shepherd of your souls.</em><br />
<strong>A reading&nbsp; from the first Letter&nbsp; of Saint&nbsp; Peter </strong>(l Peter 2:20b-25)<br />
Beloved: If when you do right and suffer for it you take it patiently, you have God&rsquo;s approval. For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps. He committed no sin; no guile was found on his lips. When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten; but he trusted to him who judges justly. He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed. For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.</p>

<p>The word of the Lord.</p>

<p><br />

<strong>GOSPEL</strong><br />
<em>I am the door of the sheep.&rdquo;</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to John (John 10:1-10)</span><br />
At that time: Jesus said, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way, that man is a thief and a robber; but he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the gatekeeper opens; the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.&rdquo; This figure Jesus used with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them. So Jesus again said to them, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. All who came before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not heed them. I am the door; if any one enters by me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy, I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING</strong><br />
<em>Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance unto life.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 11 : 1-18)</span><br />
In those days: The apostles and the brethren who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcision party criticized him, saying, &ldquo;Why did you go to uncircumcised men and eat with them?&rdquo; But Peter began and explained to them in order: &ldquo;I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, something descending, like a great sheet, let down from heaven&nbsp; by four corners; and it came down to me. Looking at it closely I observed animals and beasts of prey and reptiles and birds of the air. And I heard a voice saying to me, &lsquo;Rise, Peter; kill and eat.&rsquo; &ldquo;But I said, &lsquo;No, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth. &rsquo; &ldquo;But the voice answered a second time from heaven, &lsquo;What God has cleansed you must not call common.&rsquo; &ldquo;This happened three times, and all was drawn up again into heaven. At that very moment three men arrived at the house in which we were, sent to me from Caesarea. And the Spirit told me to go with them, making no distinction. These six brethren also accompanied me, and we entered the man&rsquo;s house. And he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, &lsquo;Send to Joppa and bring Simon called Peter; he will declare to you a message by which you will be saved, you and all your household.&rsquo; &nbsp;As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as on us at the beginning. And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, &lsquo;John baptised with water, but you shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit.&rsquo; If then God gave the same gift to them as he gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could withstand God?&rdquo; When they heard this they were silenced. And they glorified God, saying, &ldquo;Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance unto life.&rdquo;</p>

<em>The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep</em>.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to John (John 10:11-18)</span><br />
At that time: Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. He who is a hireling and not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. He flees because he is a hireling and cares nothing for the sheep. I am the good shepherd; I know my own and my own know me, as the Father knows me and I know the Father;&nbsp; and I lay down my life for the sheep. And I have other sheep, that are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will heed my voice. So there shall be one flock, one shepherd. For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again; this charge I have received from my Father.&rdquo;</p>

<em>They spoke to the Greeks also, preaching the Lord Jesus.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 11:19-26)</span><br />
In those days: Those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose over Stephen travelled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to none except Jews. But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who on coming to Antioch spoke to the Greeks also, preaching the Lord Jesus. And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number that believed turned to the Lord. News of this came to the ears of the Church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. When he came and saw the grace of God, he was glad; and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast purpose; for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a large company was added to the Lord. So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul; and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the Church, and taught a large company of people; and in Antioch the disciples were for the first time called Christians.</p>

It was the feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem; it was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the portico of Solomon. So the Jews gathered round him and said to him, &ldquo;How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are Christ, tell us plainly.&rdquo; Jesus answered them, &ldquo;I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father&rsquo;s name, they bear witness to me; but you do not believe, because you do not belong to my sheep. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me; and I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father&rsquo;s hand. I and the Father are one.&rdquo;</p>

In those days: The word of God grew and multiplied. And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their mission, bringing with them John whose other name was Mark. Now in the Church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers, Barnabas, Symeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen a member of the court of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. While they were worshipping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, &ldquo;Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.&rdquo; Then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off. So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia; and from there they sailed to Cyprus. When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews.</p>

I have come as light into the world, that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness. If any one hears my sayings and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world. He who rejects me and does not receive my sayings has a judge; the word that I have spoken will be his judge on the last day. For I have not spoken on my own authority; the Father who sent me has himself given me commandment what to say and what to speak. And I know that his commandment is eternal life. What I say, therefore, I say as the Father has bidden me.&rdquo;</p>

<em>Of David&rsquo;s posterity God has brought to Israel a Saviour, Jesus.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 13:13-25)</span><br />
Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia. And John left them and returned to Jerusalem; but they passed on from Perga and came to Antioch of Pisidia. And on the sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down. After the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, &ldquo;Brethren, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say it.&rdquo; So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said: &ldquo;Men of Israel, and you that fear God, listen. The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it. And for about forty years he bore with them in the wilderness. And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance, for about four hundred and fifty years. And after that he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet. Then they asked for a king; and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king; of whom he testified and said, &lsquo;I have found in David, the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who will do all my will.&#39; Of this man&rsquo;s posterity God has brought to Israel a Saviour, Jesus, as he promised. Before his coming John had preached a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. And as John was finishing his course, he said, &lsquo;What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but after me one is coming, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie. &rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING</strong><br />
<em>Behold, we turn to the Gentiles</em>.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles(Acts 13:26-33)</span><br />
In those days: (When Paul came to Antioch of Pisidia, he said in the synagogue,) &ldquo;Brethren, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you that fear God, to us has been sent the message of this salvation. For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not recognize him nor understand the utterances of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled these by condemning him. Though they could charge him with nothing deserving death, yet they asked Pilate to have him killed. And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb. But God raised him from the dead; and for many days he appeared to those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people. And we bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers, this he has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus; as also it is written in the second psalm, &lsquo;You are my Son, today I have begotten you.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING</strong><br />
<em>Behold, we turn to the Gentiles</em>.</br>

<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 13:44-52)</span><br />
The next sabbath almost the whole city gathered together to hear the word of God. But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted what was spoken by Paul, and reviled him. And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, &ldquo;It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken first to you. Since you thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles. For so the Lord has commanded us, saying, &lsquo;I have set you to be a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the uttermost parts of the earth. &rdquo;&rsquo; And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and glorified the word of God; and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed. And the word of the Lord spread throughout all the region. But the Jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city, and stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district. But they shook off the dust from their feet against them, and went to Iconium. And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.</p>

The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority; but the Father who dwells in me does his works. Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or else believe me for the sake of the works themselves. &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I go to the Father. Whatever you ask in my name, I will do it, that the Father may be glorified in the Son; if you ask anything in my name, I will do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Sunday:</span> <strong>The Many Ways of Giving up One&rsquo;s Life. </strong>The central theme of today&rsquo;s readings is the &ldquo;many rooms&rdquo; present in the house of the Father, that is, the many ways we can help each other. In the gospel Jesus says that the way to the Father is the service of our brothers and sisters. The second reading uses the image of a new building and the first reading describes how the community of Jerusalem solved a problem. Both readings help us to deepen our understanding of the message.</p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING</strong><br />
<em>They picked&nbsp; out seven men full of the Holy Spirit</em>.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading&nbsp; from&nbsp; the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 6:1-7)</span><br />
In these days when the disciples were increasing in number, the Hellenists murmured against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily distribution. And the Twelve summoned the body of the disciples and said, &ldquo;It is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables. Therefore, brethren, pick out from among you seven men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint to this duty. But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.&rdquo; And what they said pleased the whole multitude, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch. These they set before the apostles, and they prayed and laid their hands upon them. And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests were obedient to the faith.</p>

<p>The word of the Lord.</p>

<em>But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the first Letter of Saint Peter( Peter 2:4-9)</span><br />
Beloved: Come to the Lord, to that living stone, rejected by men but in God&rsquo;s sight chosen and precious; and like living stones be yourselves built into a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. For it stands in Scripture: &ldquo;Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone,&nbsp;&nbsp; a cornerstone chosen and precious, and he who believes in him will not be put to shame.&rdquo; To you therefore who believe, he is precious, but for those who do not believe, &ldquo;The very stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,&rdquo; and &ldquo;A stone that will make men stumble, a rock that will make them fall&rdquo;; for they stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do. But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God&rsquo;s own people, that you may declare the wonderful deeds of him who called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.</p>

<em>We bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to a living God</em>.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 14:5-18)</span><br />
In those days: When an attempt was made [at Iconium] by both Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, to molest Paul and Barnabas and to stone them, they learned of it and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the surrounding country; and there they preached the gospel. Now at Lystra there was a man sitting, who could not use his feet; he was a cripple from birth, who had never walked. He listened to Paul speaking; and Paul, looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well, said in a loud voice, &ldquo;Stand upright on your feet.&rdquo; And he sprang up and walked. And when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in Lycaonian, &ldquo;The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!&rdquo; Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, because he was the chief speaker, they called Hermes. And the priest of Zeus, whose temple was in front of the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates and wanted to offer sacrifice with the people. But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their garments and rushed out among the multitude, crying, &ldquo;Men, why are you doing this? We also are men, of like nature with you, and bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to a living God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them. In past generations he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways; yet he did not leave himself without witness, for he did good and gave you from heaven rains and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.&rdquo; With these words they scarcely restrained the people from offering sacrifice to them.</p>

<em>They gathered the Church together and declared all that God had done with them.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 14:19-25)</span><br />
In those days: Jews came [to Lystra] from Antioch and Iconium; and having persuaded the people, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead. But when the disciples gathered about him, he rose up and entered the city; and on the next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe. When they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch, strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying that through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God. And when they had appointed elders for them in every Church, with prayer and fasting, they committed them to the Lord in whom they believed.&nbsp; Then they passed through Pisidia, and came to Pamphylia. And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia; and from there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled. And when they arrived, they gathered the Church together and declared all that God had done with them, and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles. And they remained no little time with the disciples.</p>

At that time: Jesus said to his disciples, &ldquo;Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid. You heard me say to you, &lsquo;I go away, and I will come to you.&rsquo; &nbsp;If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I go to the Father; for the Father is greater than I. And now I have told you before it takes place, so that when it does take place, you may believe. I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me; but I do as the Father has commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the Father.&rdquo;</p>

<em>They were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 15:1-6)</span><br />
In those days: Some men came down from Judea and were teaching the brethren, &ldquo;Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.&rdquo; And when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them, Paul and Barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and the elders about this question. So, being sent on their way by the Church, they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, reporting the conversion of the Gentiles, and they gave great joy to all the brethren. When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the Church and the apostles and the elders, and they declared all that God had done with them. But some believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees rose up, and said, &ldquo;It is necessary to circumcise them, and to charge them to keep the Law of Moses.&rdquo; The apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider this matter.</p>

At that time: Jesus said to his disciples, &ldquo;I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. Every branch of mine that bears no fruit, he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes,&nbsp; that it may bear more fruit. You are already made clean by the word which I have spoken to you. Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in me, and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. If a man does not abide in me, he is cast forth as a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire and burned. If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you. By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit, and so prove to be my disciples.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING</strong><br />
<em>My judgement is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 15:7-12)</span><br />
In those days: After there had been much debate, Peter rose and said to the apostles and the elders, &ldquo;Brethren, you know that in the early days God made choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe. And God who knows the heart bore witness to them, giving them the &nbsp;Holy Spirit just as he did to us; and he made no distinction between us and them, but cleansed their hearts by faith. Now therefore why do you make trial of God by putting a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear? But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will.&rdquo; And all the assembly kept silence; and they listened to Barnabas and Paul as they related what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles. After they finished speaking, James replied, &ldquo;Brethren, listen to me. Symeon has related how God first visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. And with this the words of the prophets agree, as it is written, &lsquo;After this I will return, and I will rebuild the dwelling of David, which has fallen; I will rebuild its ruins, and I will set it up, that the rest of men may seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles who are called by my name, says the Lord, who has made these things known from of old.&rsquo; Therefore my judgement is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God, but should write to them to abstain from the pollutions of idols and from unchastity and from what is strangled and from blood. For from early generations Moses has had in every city those who preach him, for he is read every sabbath in the synagogues.&rdquo;</p>

<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 15:22-31)</span><br />
In those days: It seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole Church, to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They sent Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren, with the following letter: &ldquo;The brethren, both the apostles and the elders, to the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greeting. Since we have heard that some persons from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your minds, although we gave them no instructions, it has seemed good to us in assembly to choose men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, men who have risked their lives for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ. We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth. For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things: that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from unchastity. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell.&rdquo; So when they were sent off, they went down to Antioch; and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter. And when they read it, they rejoiced at the exhortation.</p>

<em>Come over to Macedonia.and help us.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles(Acts 16:1-10)</span><br />
In those days: Paul came to Derbe and to Lystra. A disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish&nbsp; woman&nbsp; who was a believer; but his father was a Greek. He was well spoken of by the brethren at Lystra and Iconium. Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek. As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered to them for observance the decisions which had been reached by the apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem. So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and they increased in numbers daily. And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia. And when they had come opposite Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them; so, passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas. And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing pleading with him and saying, &ldquo;Come over to Macedonia and help us.&rdquo; And when he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go on into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Sunday:</span> <strong>The Promise of the Spirit.</strong> The main theme of today&rsquo;s readings is Jesus&rsquo; promise to send the Paraclete, the Spirit of truth. The Spirit&rsquo;s coming will be celebrated on the feast of Pentecost. Today&rsquo;s gospel spells out how we should prepare to receive the Spirit. The second reading is a practical application of this teaching in the lives of persecuted Christians who know that the Paraclete will always be with them. The first reading shows the apostles calling down the Spirit in the imposition of hands.</p>

<em>They laid hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 8:5-8,14-17)</span><br />
In those days: Philip went down to a city of Samaria, and proclaimed to them the Christ. And the multitudes with one accord gave heed to what was said by Philip, when they heard him and saw the signs which he did. For unclean spirits came out of many who were possessed, crying with a loud voice; and many who were paralysed or lame were healed. So there was much joy in that city. Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John, who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit; for the Spirit had not yet fallen on any of them, but&nbsp; they had only been baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit.</p>

<em>Put to death in the flesh, he was made alive in the Spirit.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the first Letter of Saint Peter (1 Peter 3:15-18)</span><br />
Beloved: In your hearts reverence Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to make a defence to any one who calls you to account for the hope that is in you, yet do it with gentleness and reverence; and keep your conscience clear, so that, when you are abused, those who revile your good behaviour in Christ may be put to shame. For it is better to suffer for doing right, if that should be God&rsquo;s will, than for doing wrong. For Christ also died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the Spirit.</p>

Setting sail from Troas, we made a direct voyage to Samothrace, and the following day to Neapolis, and from there to Philippi, which is the leading city of the district of Macedonia, and a Roman colony. We remained in this city some days; and on the sabbath day we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together. One who heard us was a woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple goods, who was a worshipper of God. The Lord opened her heart to listen to what was said by Paul. And when she was baptised, with her household, she begged us, saying, &ldquo;If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay.&rdquo; And she prevailed upon us.</p>

At that time: Jesus said to his disciples, &ldquo;When the Counsellor comes, whom I shall send to you from the Father,&nbsp; even the&nbsp; Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness to me; and you also are witnesses, because you have been with me from the beginning. I have said all this to you to keep you from falling away. They will put you out of the synagogues; indeed, the hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God. And they will do this because they have not known the Father, nor me. But I have said these things to you, that when their hour comes you may remember that I told you of them.&rdquo;</p>

<em>Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.&rdquo;</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 16:22-34)</span><br />
In those days: The crowd of Philippians joined in attacking Paul and Silas; and the magistrates tore the garments off them and gave orders to beat them with rods. And when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely. Having received this charge, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks. But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners&nbsp; were&nbsp; listening&nbsp; to them,&nbsp; and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone&rsquo;s chains were unfastened. When the jailer woke and saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped. But Paul cried with a loud voice, &ldquo;Do not harm yourself, for we are all here.&rdquo; And he called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas, and brought them out and said, &ldquo;Men, what must I do to be saved?&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.&rdquo; And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all that were in his house. And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their wounds, and he was baptised at once, with all his family. Then he brought them up into his house, and set food before them; and he rejoiced with all his household that he had believed in God.</p>

At that time: Jesus said to his disciples, &ldquo;Now I am going to him who sent me; yet none of you asks me, &lsquo;Where are you going?&rsquo; But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your hearts. Nevertheless&nbsp; I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not&nbsp; go&nbsp; away,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Counsellor&nbsp; will not&nbsp; come&nbsp; to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. And when he comes, he will convince the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgement: of sin, because they do not believe in me; of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will see me no more; of judgement, because the ruler of this world is judged.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING </strong><br />
<em>What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading&nbsp; from the Acts of the&nbsp; Apostles (Acts 17: 15.22-18: 1)</span><br />
In those days: Those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and receiving a command&nbsp; for&nbsp; Silas and Timothy to&nbsp; come&nbsp; to him as soon as possible, they departed. So Paul, standing in the middle of the&nbsp; Areopagus,&nbsp; said:&nbsp; &ldquo;Men&nbsp; of Athens,&nbsp; I&nbsp; perceive&nbsp; that in every way you are very religious. For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found&nbsp; also&nbsp; an&nbsp; altar with this inscription, &lsquo;To an unknown god.&rsquo; What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you. The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in shrines made by man, nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all men life and breath and everything. And he made from&nbsp; one&nbsp; every nation of men to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted&nbsp; periods&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; boundaries&nbsp; of&nbsp; their&nbsp; habitation,&nbsp; that they should seek God, in the hope that they might feel after him and find him. Yet he is not far from each one of us, for &lsquo;In him we live and move and have our being&rsquo;; &nbsp;as even some of your poets have said, &lsquo;For we are indeed his offspring.&rsquo; Being then God&rsquo;s offspring, we ought not to think that the Deity is like gold, or silver, or stone, a representation by the art and imagination of man. The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all men everywhere to repent, because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and of this he has given assurance to all men by raising him from the dead.&rdquo; Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, &ldquo;We will hear you again about this.&rdquo; So Paul went out from among them. But some men joined him and believed, among them Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them. After this he left Athens and went to Corinth.</p>

<em>He stayed with them, and they worked, and he argued in the synagogue.</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 18: 1-8)</span><br />
In those days: Paul left Athens and went to Corinth. And he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, lately come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. And he went to see them; and because he was of the same trade he stayed with them, and they worked, for by trade they were tentmakers. And he argued in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks. When Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul was occupied with preaching, testifying to the Jews that the Christ was Jesus. And when they opposed and reviled him, he shook out his garments and said to them, &ldquo;Your blood be upon your heads! I am innocent. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.&rdquo; And he left there and went to the house of a man named Titus Justus, a worshipper of God; his house was next door to the synagogue. Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, together with all his household; and many of the Corinthians hearing Paul believed and were baptised.</p>

[When Paul was in Corinth,] the Lord said to him one night in a vision, &ldquo;Do not be afraid, but speak and do not be silent; for I am with you, and no man shall attack you to harm you; for I have many people in this city.&rdquo; And he stayed a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.&nbsp; But&nbsp; when&nbsp; Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a united attack upon Paul and brought him before the tribunal, saying, &ldquo;This man is persuading men to worship God contrary to the law.&rdquo; But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, &ldquo;If it were a matter of wrongdoing or vicious crime, I should have reason to bear with you, O Jews; but since it is a matter of questions about words and names and your own law, see to it yourselves; I refuse to be a judge of these things.&rdquo; And he drove them from the tribunal. And they all seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue,&nbsp; and beat him in front of the tribunal. But Gallio paid no attention to this. After this Paul stayed many days longer, and then took leave of the brethren and sailed for Syria, and with him Priscilla and. Aquila. At Cenchreae he cut his hair, for he had a vow.</p>

<em>Apollos showed by the Scriptures that the Christ was Jesus.</em></br>
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles Acts 18:23-28</span><br />
After spending some time in Antioch, Paul departed and went from place to place through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples. Now a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent man, well versed in the Scriptures. He had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in&nbsp; spirit, he&nbsp; spoke&nbsp; and taught&nbsp; accurately the things concerning Jesus, though&nbsp; he knew&nbsp; only the baptism&nbsp; of John. He began to speak boldly in the synagogue; but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him and expounded to him the way of God more accurately. And when he wished to cross to Achaia, the brethren encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him. When he arrived, he greatly helped those who through grace had believed, for he powerfully confuted the Jews in public, showing by the Scriptures that the Christ was Jesus.</p>

Beloved: Rejoice in so far as you share Christ&rsquo;s sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed. If you are reproached for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or a wrong-doer, or a mischief- maker; yet if one suffers as a Christian, let him not &nbsp;be &nbsp;ashamed, &nbsp;but under that name let him glorify God.<br />

I glorified you on earth, having accomplished the work which you gave me to do; and now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory which I had with you before the world was made.

<em>&ldquo;Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed? &rdquo;</em><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles Acts 19:1-8</span><br />
While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the upper country and came to Ephesus. There he found some disciples. And he said to them, &ldquo;Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;No, we have never even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Into what then were you baptised?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;Into John&rsquo;s baptism.&rdquo; And Paul said, &ldquo;John baptised with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, Jesus.&rdquo; On hearing this, they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spoke with tongues and prophesied. There were about twelve of them in all. And he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly, arguing&nbsp; and pleading&nbsp; about the kingdom&nbsp; of God.</p>

In those days: From Miletus Paul went to Ephesus and called to him the elders of the Church.

And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem, bound in the Spirit, not knowing what shall befall me there; except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and afflictions await me. But I do not&nbsp;account my&nbsp;life of any value nor&nbsp; as precious&nbsp; to myself, if only I may accomplish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God. And now, behold, I know that all you among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom will see my face no more.

For behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed; for he who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name. And his mercy is on those who fear him from generation to generation. He has shown strength with his arm, he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts, he has put down the mighty from their thrones, and exalted those of low degree; he has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent empty away. He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy, as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his posterity for ever.&rdquo; And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her home.</p>

But when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; other&nbsp; Pharisees,&nbsp; he&nbsp; cried&nbsp; out&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; council, &ldquo;Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees; with respect to the hope and resurrection of the dead I am on trial.&rdquo; And when he had said this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and the assembly was divided. For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor spirit; but the Pharisees acknowledge them all. Then a great clamour arose; and some of the scribes of the Pharisees&rsquo; party stood up and contended, &ldquo;we find nothing wrong in this man. What if a spirit or an angel spoke to him?&rdquo; And when the dissension became violent, the tribune, afraid that Paul would be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them and bring him into the barracks.

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 25: 13b-21)</span><br />
In those days: Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to welcome Festus. And as they stayed there many days, Festus laid Paul&rsquo;s case before the king, saying, &ldquo;There is a man left prisoner by Felix; and when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews gave information about him, asking for sentence against him. I answered them that it was not the custom of the Romans to give up any one before the accused met the accusers face to face, and had opportunity to make his defence concerning the charge laid against him. When therefore they came together here, I made no delay, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man brought in. When the accusers stood up, they brought no charge in his case of such evils as I supposed; but they had certain points of dispute with him about their own superstition and about one Jesus, who was dead, but whom Paul asserted to be alive. Being at a loss how to investigate these questions, I asked whether he wished to go to Jerusalem and be tried there regarding them. But when Paul had appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be held until I could send him to Caesar.</p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING</strong><br />
He lived in Rome, preaching the kingdom of God.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading&nbsp; from the Acts&nbsp; of the Apostles (Acts 25 : 16-20.30-31)</span><br />
When we came into Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier that guarded him. After three days he called together the local leaders of the Jews; and when they had gathered, he said to them, &ldquo;Brethren, though I had done nothing against the people or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans. When they had examined me, they wished to set me at liberty, because there was no reason for the death penalty in my case. But when the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar &mdash; though I had no charge to bring against my nation. For this reason therefore I have asked to see you and speak with you, since it is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.&rdquo; And he lived there two whole years at his own expense, and welcomed all who came to him, preaching the kingdom of&nbsp; God&nbsp; and&nbsp; teaching&nbsp; about&nbsp; the Lord Jesus Christ quite openly and unhindered.</p>

This is the disciple who has written these things, and his testimony is true.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to John (John 21:20-25)</span><br />
At that time: Peter turned and saw following them the disciple whom Jesus loved, who had lain close to his breast at the supper and had said, &ldquo;Lord, who is it that is going to betray you?&rdquo; When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, &ldquo;Lord, what about this man?&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you? Follow me!&rdquo; The saying spread abroad among the brethren that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die, but, &ldquo;If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?&rdquo; This is the disciple who is bearing witness to these things, and who has written these things; and we know that his testimony is true. But there are also many other things which Jesus did; were every one of them to be written, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.</p>

<p><strong>VIGIL OF PENTECOST</strong><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">At the Vigil Mass<br />
This Mass is used on the Saturday evening, either before or after First Vespers (Evening Prayer I) of Pentecost Sunday. The fifty days of the sacred season of Easter concludes with Pentecost Sunday, when the Church recalls the gift of the Holy Spirit to the Apostles, the beginnings of the Church, and the start of her mission to all tongues and peoples and nations. It is fitting that the Vigil Mass be celebrated in a more ample form, using the readings and prayers to be found in the liturgical books. At mass, however, does not have a baptismal character, as does the Easter Vigil.</span></p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING</strong><br />
Its name was called Babel, because there the Lord confused the language of all the earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Genesis (Genesis 11 : 1-9)</span><br />
The whole earth had one language and few words. And as men migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. And they said to one another, &ldquo;Come, let us make bricks, and bum them thoroughly.&rdquo; And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar. Then they said, &ldquo;Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered&nbsp; abroad upon&nbsp; the face of the whole earth.&rdquo; And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the sons of men had built. And the Lord said, &ldquo;Behold, they are one people, and they have&nbsp; all one language; and this is only the beginning of what they&nbsp; will&nbsp; do;&nbsp; and&nbsp; nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them. Come, let us go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another&rsquo;s speech.&rdquo; So the Lord scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city. Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the Lord confused the language of all the earth; and from there the Lord scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth.</p>

The Lord came down upon Mount Sinai before all the people.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading&nbsp; from the&nbsp; Book&nbsp; of Exodus (Exodus &nbsp;19:3-8a.16-20b)</span><br />
In those days: Moses went up to God, and the Lord called to him out of the mountain, saying, &ldquo;Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the sons of Israel: You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on&nbsp; eagles&rsquo; wings&nbsp; and brought&nbsp; you&nbsp; to myself. Now therefore, if you will obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my own possession among all peoples; for all the earth is mine, and you shall be to me a kingdom of &nbsp;priests and a holy nation. These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.&rdquo; So Moses came and called the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which the Lord had commanded him. And all the people answered together and said, &ldquo;All that the Lord has spoken we will do.&rdquo; On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning, and a thick cloud upon the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast, so that all the people who were in the camp trembled. Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God; and they took their stand at the foot of the mountain. And Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke, because the Lord descended upon it in fire; and the smoke of it went up like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain quaked greatly. And as the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him in thunder. And the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain; and the Lord called Moses to the top of the mountain.</p>

Dry bones, I will put my spirit within you, and you shall live.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of the Prophet Ezekiel (Ezekiel 37:1-14)</span><br />
In those days: The hand of the Lord was upon me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the valley; it was full of bones. And he led me round among them; and behold, there were very many upon the valley; and behold, they were very dry. And he said to me, &ldquo;Son of man, can these bones live?&rdquo; And I answered, &ldquo;O Lord God, you know.&rdquo; Again he said to me, &ldquo;Prophesy to these bones, and say to them, O dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. Thus says the Lord God to these bones: Behold, I will cause the spirit to enter you, and you shall live. And I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to come upon you, and cover you with skin, and put spirit in you, and you shall live; and you shall know that I am the Lord.&rdquo; So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, a rattling; and the bones came together, bone to its bone. And as I looked, there were sinews on them, and flesh had come upon them, and skin had covered them; but there was no spirit in them. Then he said to me, &ldquo;Prophesy to the spirit, prophesy, son of man, and say to the spirit, Thus says the Lord God: Come from the four winds, O spirit, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.&rdquo; So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the spirit came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet, an exceedingly great host. Then he said to me, &ldquo;Son of man, these &rsquo; bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, &lsquo;Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off. &rsquo; Therefore prophesy, and say to them, Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will open your graves, and raise you from your graves, O my people; and I will bring you home into the land of Israel. And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I open your graves, and raise you from your graves, O my people. And I will put my Spirit within you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land; then you shall know that I, the Lord, have spoken, and I have done it, says the Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book&nbsp; of the Prophet&nbsp; Joel (Joel 2:28-32)</span><br />
The Lord said to his people: &ldquo;And it shall come to pass afterwards, that I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions. Even upon the menservants and maidservants in those days, I will pour out my spirit. &ldquo;And I will give signs in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and columns of smoke. The sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the great and awesome day of the Lord comes. And it shall come to pass that all who call upon the name of the Lord shall be delivered; for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those who escape, as the Lord has said, and among the survivors shall be those whom the Lord calls.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>SECOND READING</strong><br />
The Spirit himself intercedes for us with sighs too deep for words.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the&nbsp; Romans (Romans 8:22-27)</span><br />
Brethren: We know that the whole creation has been groaning with labour pains together until now; and not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. For in this hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees? But if we &#39;hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience. Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with sighs too deep for words. And he who searches the hearts of men knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.</p>

On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and proclaimed, &ldquo;If any one thirst, let him come to me and drink. He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, &lsquo;Out of his heart shall flow rivers of living water. &rdquo;&rsquo; Now this he said about the Spirit, which those who believed in him were to receive; for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</p>

Through our Lord...</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Sunday:</span> <strong>The Spirit, New Law of the Christian.</strong> The first reading and the gospel talk of the descent of the Spirit. The stories of Luke and John complement each other and teach us that the Spirit is the new law, the force that leads us to do good. The Spirit is the source of unity. It pulls down barriers and wherever it enters it destroys sin. The second reading describes a consequence of the presence of the Spirit. Each of us has been given gifts by the same Spirit and they must not be a source of competition but must rather be put at the service of unity.</p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING</strong><br />
They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading&nbsp; from the Acts of the&nbsp; Apostles (Acts 2:1-11)</span><br />
When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place. And suddenly a sound came from heaven like the rush of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared to them tongues as of fire, distributed and resting on each one of them. And they were all filled with&nbsp; the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from every nation under heaven. And at this sound the multitude came together, and they were bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in his own language. And they were amazed and wondered, saying, &ldquo;Are not all these who are speaking Galileans? And how is it that&nbsp; we hear,&nbsp; each of us in his own native language? Parthians and Medes and Elamites and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia,&nbsp; Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabians, we hear them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the first Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians (1 Corinthians 12:3b-7. 12-13)</span><br />
Brethren: No one can say &ldquo;Jesus is Lord&rdquo; except by the Holy Spirit. Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are varieties of service, but the&nbsp; same&nbsp; Lord;&nbsp; and there&nbsp; are varieties of working, but it is the same God who inspires them all in every one. To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. For just as the body is one and has many members,&nbsp; and all the members&nbsp; of the&nbsp; body,&nbsp; though&nbsp; many,&nbsp; are&nbsp; one body,&nbsp; so it is with Christ. For by one Spirit we were all baptised into one body &mdash; Jews or Greeks, slaves or free &mdash; and all were made to drink of one Spirit.</p>

&ldquo;Tobit walked in the ways of truth.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">The beginning&nbsp; of the Book&nbsp; of Tobit Tobit I :3; 2 :1 &mdash;8</span><br />
I, Tobit, walked in the ways of truth and righteousness all the days of my life, and I performed many acts of charity to my brethren and countrymen who went with me into the land of the Assyrians, to Nineveh. When I arrived home and my wife Anna and my son Tobias were restored to me, at the feast of Pentecost, which is the sacred festival of the seven weeks, a good dinner was prepared for me and I sat down to eat. Upon seeing the abundance of food I said to my son, &ldquo;Go and bring whatever poor man of our brethren you may find among the exiles in Nineveh, who is mindful of the Loco, and he shall eat together with me. I will wait for you until you come back.&rdquo; So Tobias went out to look for some poor person of our people. When he came back, he said, &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; And I replied, &ldquo;Here I am, my child.&rdquo; Then he went on to say, &ldquo;Look, Father, one of our people has been murdered and thrown into the market place, and now he lies there strangled.&rdquo; So before I tasted anything I sprang up and removed the body to a place of shelter until sunset when I might bury it. And when I returned I washed myself and ate my food in sorrow. Then I remembered the prophecy ofAmos, how he said against Bethel, &ldquo;Your feasts shall be turned into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation.&rdquo; And I wept. When the sun had set I went and dug a grave and buried the body. And my neighbours laughed at me and said, &ldquo;He is still not afraid; he has already been hunted down to be put to death for doing this, and he ran away, yet here he is burying the dead again!&rdquo;</p>

They took the beloved son, killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark (Mark 12: I - )</span><br />
At that time: Jesus began to speak to the chief priests and the scribes and the elders in parables. &ldquo;A man planted a vineyard, and set a hedge around it, and dug a pit for the wine press, and built&nbsp; a tower, and leased it to tenants, and went into another country. When the time came, he sent a servant to the tenants, to get from them&nbsp; some of the fruit of the vineyard. And they&nbsp; took him&nbsp;and beat him, and sent him away empty-handed. Again he sent to them another servant, and they wounded him in the head, and treated him shamefully. And he sent another, and him they killed; and so with many others, some they beat and some they killed.&rdquo; He had still one other, a beloved son; finally he sent him to them, saying, &lsquo;They will respect my son.&rsquo; But those tenants said to one another, &lsquo;This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.&rsquo; And they took him and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard. &ldquo;What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants, and give the vineyard to others. Have you not read this Scripture: &lsquo;The very stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner; this was the Lord&rsquo;s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes&rsquo;?&rdquo; And they tried to arrest him, but feared the multitude, for they perceived that he had told the par- able against them; so they left him and went away.</p>

<p>FIRST READING<br />
I went to physicians, but they did not help me.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Tobit (Tobit2:9-114)</span><br />
On [Pentecost] night I, Tobit, returned from burying the dead, I went into my courtyard and slept by the wall of the courtyard, and my face was uncovered because of the heat. I did not know that there were sparrows on the wall and their fresh droppings fell into my open eyes and white films formed on my eyes. I went to physicians to be healed, but the more they treated me with ointments, the more my vision was obscured by the white films, until I became completely blind. For four years I remained unable to see. All my kindred were sorry for me, and Ahikar took care of &nbsp;me for two years until he went to Elymais. Then my wife Anna earned money at women&rsquo;s work. She used to send the product to the owners, and they paid her wages. One day, the seventh of Dystrus, when she cut off a piece she had woven and sent it to the owners, they paid her full wages and they also gave her a kid. When she returned to me it began to bleat.&nbsp; So I called her and said to her, &ldquo;Where did you get the kid? It is not stolen, is it? Return it to the owners; for it is not right to eat what is stolen.&rdquo; And she said, &ldquo;It was given to me as a gift in addition to my wages.&rdquo; But I did not believe her, and told her to return it to the owners; and I blushed for her. Then she replied to me, &ldquo;Where are your charities and your righteous deeds? You seem to know everything!&rdquo;</p>

At that time: They sent to Jesus some of the Pharisees and some of the Herodians, to entrap him in his talk. And they came&nbsp; and&nbsp; said&nbsp; to him, &ldquo;Teacher, we know that you are true, and care for no man; for you do not regard the position of men, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? Should we pay them, or should we not?&rdquo; But knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them, &ldquo;Why put me to the test? Bring me a coin, and let me look at it.&rdquo; And they brought one. And he said to them, &ldquo;Whose likeness and inscription is this?&rdquo; They said to him, &ldquo;Caesar&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar&rsquo;s, and to God the things that are God&rsquo;s.&rdquo; And they were&nbsp; amazed&nbsp; at &nbsp;him.</p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING</strong><br />
The prayer &lsquo;of both was heard in the presence of the glory of God.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Tobit&nbsp;&nbsp;(Tobit 3 : 1- 11a.16-17a</span><br />
In those days: in my grief I wept, and&nbsp; I prayed&nbsp; in anguish,&nbsp; saying, &ldquo;Righteous are you, O Lord; all your deeds are just and all your ways are mercy and truth, and you render true and righteous judgement for ever. And now, O Lord, remember me and look favourably upon me; do not punish me for my sins and for my unwitting offences and those which my fathers committed before you. For we disobeyed your commandments, and you gave us over to plunder, captivity, and death; you made us the talk, the byword, and an object of reproach in all the nations among which you have dispersed us. And now your many judgements are true in exacting penalty from me for my sins and those of my fathers, because we did not keep your commandments. For we did not walk in truth before you. And now deal with me according to your pleasure; command my spirit to be taken up, that I may be released from the face of the earth and become dust. For it is better for me to die than to live, because I have heard false reproaches, and great is the sorrow within me. Command that I now be released from my distress; release me to go to the eternal abode; and do not, O Lord, turn your face away from me. For it is better for me to die than to see so much distress in my life and to listen to such insults.&rdquo; On the same day, at Ecbatana in Media, it also happened that Sarah, the daughter of Raguel, was reproached by her father&rsquo;s maids, because she had been given to seven husbands, and the evil demon Asmodeus had slain each of them before he had been with her as his wife. So the maids said to her, &ldquo;You are the one who kills your husbands! See, you already have had seven and have had no benefit from any of them. Why do you beat us? Because your husbands are dead? Go with them! May we never see a son or daughter of yours!&rdquo; On that day she was deeply grieved in spirit and wept. When she had gone up to her father&rsquo;s upper room, she intended to hang herself. But she thought it over and said, &ldquo;Never shall they reproach my father, saying to him, &lsquo;You only had one beloved daughter but she hanged herself because of her distress. &rsquo; And I shall bring his old age down in sorrow to the grave. It is better for me not to hang myself, but to pray the Lord that I may die and not listen to these reproaches any more.&rdquo; At that same time, with hands outstretched towards the window, she prayed and said, &ldquo;Blessed are you, O Lord, merciful God, and blessed is your holy and honoured name.&rdquo; At that very moment, the prayer of both was heard in the presence of the glory of the great God. And Raphael was sent to heal the two of them.</p>

At that time: Sadducees came to Jesus, who say that there is no resurrection; and they asked him a question, saying, &ldquo;Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man&rsquo;s brother dies and&nbsp; leaves&nbsp; a wife, but leaves no child, the man must take the wife, and raise up children for his brother. There were seven brothers; the first took a wife, and when he died left no children; and the second took her, and died, leaving no children; and the third likewise; and the seven left no children. Last of all the woman also died. In the resurrection whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife.&rdquo; Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Is not this why you are wrong, that you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God? For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. And as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God said to him, &lsquo;I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob&rsquo;? He is not God of the dead, but of the living; you are quite wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING</strong><br />
Grant that I may find mercy and may grow old together with her.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Tobit (Tobit 6:9- 12; 7:1 cd.9- 12.1 6; 8: 1.4-9a)</span><br />
In those days: when he entered Media and was already approaching Ecbatana, Raphael said to the young man, &ldquo;Brother Tobias!&rdquo; &ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; he answered. Then Raphael said to him, &ldquo;We must stay this night in the home of Raguel. He is your relative, and he has a daughter named Sarah. He has no male heir and no daughter except Sarah only, and you, as next of kin to her; have before all other men a hereditary claim on her. Also, it is right for you to inherit her father&rsquo;s possessions. Moreover, the girl is sensible, brave, and very beautiful, and her father is a good man.&rdquo; And they found Raguel sitting beside the courtyard door. They greeted him first, and he replied, &ldquo;Joyous greetings, brothers; welcome and good health!&rdquo; Then he brought them into his house. Then Raguel killed a ram from the flock and received them very warmly. When they had bathed and washed themselves and had reclined to dine, Tobias said to Raphael, &ldquo;Brother Azarius, ask Raguel to give me my kinswoman Sarah.&rdquo; But Raguel overheard it and said to Tobias, &ldquo;Eat, drink, and be merry; for no one except you, brother, has the right to marry my daughter Sarah. Likewise, I am not at liberty to give her to any other man than yourself, because you are my nearest relative. But let me explain the true situation to you. I have given my daughter to seven men of our kinsmen, and when each came to her he died in the night.&nbsp; But for the present, my child, eat and drink, and the Lord will act on behalf of you both.&rdquo; But Tobias said, &ldquo;I will eat nothing here until you make a binding agreement with me.&rdquo; So Raguel said, &ldquo;I will do so. She is given to you in accordance with the decree in the book of Moses, and it has been decreed from heaven that she be given to you. Take your kinswompn; from now on you are her brother and. she is your sister. She is given to you from today and for ever, May the Lord of heaven, my child, guide and prosper you both this night and grant you mercy and peace.&rdquo; And Raguel called his wife Edna and said to her, &ldquo;Sister, make up the other room and take her into it.&rdquo; When they had finished eating and drinking they wanted to retire; so they took the young man and brought him into the bedroom. When the door was shut and the two were alone, Tobias got up from the bed and, said, &ldquo;Sister, get up, and let us pray and implore our Lord that he grant us mercy and safety.&rdquo; And they began to say, &ldquo;Blessed are you, O God of our fathers, and blessed be your holy and glorious name for ever. Let the heavens and all your creatures bless you. You made Adam and gave him Eve his wife as a helper and support. From them the race of mankind has sprung. You said, &lsquo;It is not good that the man should be alone; let us make a helper for him like himself. &rsquo; And now, O Lord, I am not taking this sister of mine because of lust, but with sincerity. Grant that I may find mercy and may grow old together with her.&rdquo; And they both said, &ldquo;Amen, amen.&rdquo; Then they both went to sleep for the night.</p>

There is no other commandment greater than these.&rdquo; And the scribe said to him, &ldquo;You are right, Teacher; you have truly said that he is one, and there is no other but he; and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength, and to love one&rsquo;s neighbour as oneself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.&rdquo; And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, &ldquo;You are not far from the kingdom of God.&rdquo; And after that no one dared to ask him any question.</p>

God himself has afflicted me, but here I see my son Tobias.</p>

In those days: Anna sat looking intently down the road for her son. And she caught sight of him coming, and said to his father, &ldquo;Behold, your son is coming, and so is the man who went with him!&rdquo; Raphael said to Tobias, before they approached his father, &ldquo;I know that his eyes will be opened. Smear the gall of the fish on his eyes, and the medicine will cause the white films to fall away. And your father will regain his sight and see the light.&rdquo; Then Anna ran to meet them, and embraced her son, and said to him, &ldquo;I have seen you, my child; now I am ready to die.&rdquo; And she wept. Tobit got up, and came stumbling out through the courtyard door. But his son ran to him with the gall of the fish in his hand, and holding him firmly, he blew into his eyes, saying, &ldquo;Take courage, Father.&rdquo; With this he applied the medicine on his eyes. Next with both his hands, he peeled off the white films from the corners of his eyes. Then he saw his son and embraced him, and he wept and said, &ldquo;Here I see my son, the light of my eyes!&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;Blessed be God, and blessed be his great name, and blessed be all his holy angels. May his holy name be blessed throughout all the ages. Though he afflicted me, he has had mercy on me. Now I see my son Tobias!</p>

And now give thanks to God, for I am ascending to him.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Tobit (Tobit 12:1.5-15.20)</span><br />
In those days: Tobit called his son Tobias and said to him,&nbsp; &ldquo;My&nbsp; son, see to the wages of the man who went with you; and he must also be given more.&rdquo; So he called the angel and said to him, &ldquo;Take for your wages half of all that you two have brought back, and farewell.&rdquo; Then the angel called the two of them privately and said to them: &ldquo;Praise God and give thanks to him; exalt him and give thanks to him in the presence of all the living for what he has done for you. It is good to praise God and to exalt his name, worthily declaring the works of God. Do not be slow to give him thanks. It is good to guard the secret of a king, but gloriously to reveal the works of God, and with fitting honour to acknowledge him. Do good, and evil will not overtake you. Prayer is good when accompanied by fasting, almsgiving, and righteousness. A little with righteousness is better than much with wrongdoing. It is better to give alms than to treasure up gold. For almsgiving delivers from death, and it will purge away every sin. Those who perform deeds of charity and of righteousness will have fulness of life; but those who commit sin are the enemies of their own lives. I will now declare the whole truth to you and I will not conceal anything from you. I have said, &lsquo;It is good to guard the secret of a king, but gloriously to reveal the works of God.&rsquo; And so, when you and your daughter-in-law Sarah prayed, I brought a reminder of your prayer before the Holy One; and when you buried the dead, I was likewise present with you. When you did not hesitate to rise and leave your dinner in order to go and lay out the dead, I was sent to test you. So now God sent me to heal you and your daughter-in- law Sarah. I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels who &nbsp;present the prayers of the saints and enter into the presence of the glory of the Lord. And now bless the Lord upon the earth and give thanks to God, for I am ascending to him who sent me. Write in a book everything that has happened to you.</p>

At that time: In his teaching Jesus said, &ldquo;Beware of the scribes, who like to go about in long robes, and to have salutations in the market places and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honour at feasts, who devour widows&rsquo; houses and for a pretence make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.&rdquo; And he sat down opposite the treasury, and watched the multitude putting money into the treasury. Many rich people put in large sums. And a poor widow came, and put in two copper coins, which make a penny. And he called his disciples to him, and said to them, &ldquo;Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury. For they all contributed out of their abundance; but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had, her whole living.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Feast: </span><strong>In What Kind of God Do You Believe?</strong> All three readings teach us today something about the nature of God. The first tells us that the biblical God is quite different from the god worshipped by people of other religions. God does not become angry, is not wilful, does not punish us and is not spying on us. The gospel tells us that he has not moved away from us, but has joined his life to the world and to ours. The second reading teaches us that God is family, a family open to us all.</p>

The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Exodus (Exodus 34:4b-6.8-9)</span><br />
In those days: Moses rose early in the morning and went up on Mount Sinai, as the Lord had commanded him, and took in his hand two tables of stone. And the Lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the Lord. The Lord passed before him, and proclaimed, &ldquo;The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness.&rdquo; And Moses made haste to bow his head towards the&nbsp; earth, and worshipped.&nbsp; And he said, &ldquo;If now I have found favour in your sight, O Lord, let the Lord, I beg you, go in the midst of us, although it is a stiff-necked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.&rdquo;</p>

God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God sent the Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him. He who believes in him is not condemned; he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God.</p>

For as we share abundantly in Christ&rsquo;s sufferings, so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too. If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation, and if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which you experience when you patiently endure the same sufferings that we suffer.

Jesus was not Yes and No,&rsquo; but in him if is always Yes.</p>

<p>A reading from the second Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 1 : 18-22)<br />
Brethren: As surely as God is faithful, our word to you has not been Yes and No.&nbsp; For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we preached among you,&nbsp; Silvanus and Timothy and I, was not&nbsp; Yes and No; but in him it is always Yes. For all the promises of God find their Yes in him. That is why we utter the Amen through him, to the glory of God. But it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, and has commissioned us; he has put his seal upon us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.</p>

He made us ministers of a new covenant, not in a written code but in the Spirit.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the second Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 3 :4-11)</span><br />
Brethren: Such is the confidence that we have through Christ towards God. Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to claim anything as coming from us; our sufficiency is from God, who has qualified us to be ministers of a new covenant, not in a written code but in the Spirit; for the written code kills, but the Spirit gives life. Now if the dispensation of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such splendour that the Israelites could not look at Moses&rsquo; face because of its brightness, fading as this was, will not the dispensation of the Spirit be attended with greater splendour? For if there was splendour in the dispensation of condemnation, the dispensation of righteousness must far exceed it in splendour. Indeed, in this case, what once had splendour has come to have no splendour at all, because of the splendour that surpasses it. For if what faded away came with splendour, what is permanent must have much more splendour.</p>

For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING</strong><br />
God has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the second Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 3:15-4:1.3-6)</span><br />
Brethren: To this day whenever Moses is read a veil lies over the minds of the Israelites; but when a man turns to the Lord the veil is removed. Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being changed into his likeness from one degree of glory to another; for this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit. Therefore, having this ministry by the mercy of God, we do not lose heart. And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled only&nbsp; to those who are perishing. In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the likeness of God. For what we preach is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, with ourselves as your servants for Jesus&rsquo; sake. For it is the God who said, &ldquo;Let light shine out of darkness,&rdquo; who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.</p>

You have heard that it was said to the men of old, &lsquo;You shall not kill; and whoever kills shall be liable to judgement. &rsquo; But I say to you that every one who is angry with his brother shall be liable to judgement; whoever insults his brother shall be liable to the council, and whoever says, &lsquo;You fool! &#39; shall be liable to the hell of fire. So if you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. Make friends quickly with your accuser, while you are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison; truly, 1 say to you, you will never get out till you have paid the last penny.&rdquo;</p>

For while we live we are always being given up to death for Jesus&rsquo; sake, so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh. So death is at work in us, but life in you. Since we have the same spirit of faith as he had who wrote, &ldquo;I believed, and so I spoke,&rdquo; we too believe, and so we speak, knowing that&nbsp; he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence.

For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the second Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 5: 14-21)</span><br />
Brethren: The love of Christ urges us on, because we are convinced that one has died for all; therefore all have died. And he died for all, that those who live might live no longer for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised. From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh; even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus no longer. Therefore, if any one is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has passed away, behold, the new has come. All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation; that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation. So we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.</p>

The gospel presents a gift immensely superior to manna, it is the bread that gives eternal life. To eat such bread means to want to be identified with Christ. The second reading tells us that the Eucharist is not bread to be eaten alone. It is broken and shared as a means and sign of unity.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>FIRST READING</strong><br />
He fed you with manna, which you did not know, nor did your fathers</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 8:2-3.14b-16a)</span><br />
Moses spoke to the people, saying, You shall remember all the way which the Lord your God has led you these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble you, testing you to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments, or not. And he humbled you and let you hunger and fed you with manna, which you did not know, nor did your fathers know; that he might make you know that man does not live by bread alone, but that man lives by everything that proceeds out of the mouth&nbsp; of the Lord. &ldquo;And you shall remember the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, who led you through the great and terrible wilderness, with its fiery serpents and scorpions and thirsty ground where there was no water, who brought you water out of the flinty rock, who fed you in the wilderness with manna which your fathers did not know.</p>

<p>The word of the Lord.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">RESPONSORIAL PSALM Psalm 147: 12-13.14- I 5.19-20 (R. 12a)</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span> O Jerusalem, glorify the Lord!<br />
Or: Alleluia.</strong></p>

<p>O Jerusalem, glorify the Lord!<br />
O Sion, praise your God!<br />
He has strengthened the bars of your gates;<br />
he has blessed your children within you. <span style="color:#ff0000">R</span>.</p>

<p>He established peace on your borders;<br />
he gives you your fill of finest wheat.<br />
He sends out his word to the earth,<br />
and swiftly runs his command. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p>He reveals his word to Jacob;<br />
to Israel, his decrees and judgements.<br />
He has not dealt thus with other nations;<br />
he has not taught them his judgements. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>SECOND READING</strong><br />
Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the first Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians (1 Corinthians 10: 16- 17)</span><br />
Brethren: The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.</p>

<p>The word of the Lord</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">The following sequence, Lauda, Sion, is optional before the Alleluia verse. The sequence may be used either in its entirety or in the shorter form, beginning with the words *Behold the bread.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Sequence</strong></p>

<p>Zion, praise your Saviour.<br />
Praise your leader and shepherd in hymns and canticles.<br />
Praise him as much as you can, for he is beyond all praising<br />
and you will never be able to praise him as he merits.<br />
But today a theme worthy of particular praise<br />
is put before us &mdash; the living and life- giving bread<br />
that, without any doubt,<br />
was given to the Twelve at table during the holy supper.<br />
Therefore let our praise be full and resounding<br />
and our soul&rsquo;s rejoicing full of delight and beauty,<br />
for this is the festival day<br />
to commemorate the first institution of this table.<br />
At this table of the new King,<br />
the new law&rsquo;s new Pasch puts an end to the old Pasch.<br />
The new displaces the old, reality the shadow and light the darkness.<br />
Christ wanted what he did at the supper<br />
to be repeated in his memory.<br />
And so we, in accordance with his holy directions<br />
consecrate bread and wine to be salvation&rsquo;s Victim.<br />
Christ&rsquo;s followers know by faith that bread is changed into his flesh and wine into his blood.<br />
Man cannot understand this, cannot perceive it;<br />
but a lively faith affirms that the change,<br />
which is outside the natural course of things, takes place.<br />
Under the different species,<br />
which are now signs only and not their own reality,<br />
there lie hid wonderful realities. His body is our food, his blood our<br />
And yet Christ remains entire under each species.<br />
The communicant receives the complete Christ &mdash;<br />
uncut, unbroken and undivided. Whether one receive or a thousand, the one receives as much as the thousand.<br />
Nor is Christ diminished by being received.<br />
The good and the wicked alike receive him,<br />
but with the unlike destiny of life or death.<br />
To the wicked it is death, but life to the good.<br />
See how different is the result, though each receives the same.<br />
Last of all,<br />
if the sacrament is broken, have no doubt.<br />
Remember there is as much in a fragment<br />
as in an unbroken host.<br />
There is no division of the reality, but only a breaking of the sign; nor does the breaking diminish the condition or size<br />
of the One hidden under the sign.<br />
* Behold, the bread of angels is become the pilgrim&rsquo;s food; truly it is bread for the sons, and is not to be cast to dogs.<br />
It was prefigured in type<br />
when Isaac was brought as an offering, when a lamb was appointed for the Pasch<br />
and when manna was given to the Jews of old.<br />
Jesus, good shepherd and true bread, have mercy on us; feed us and guard us. Grant that we find happiness in the land of the living.<br />
You know all things, can do all things, and feed us here on earth.<br />
Make us your guests in heaven,<br />
co-heirs with you and companions of heaven&rsquo;s citizens.<br />
Amen. Alleluia</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the&nbsp; holy Gospel&nbsp; according to John (John&nbsp; 6 :51-58)</span><br />
At that time: Jesus said to the crowds of the Jews, &ldquo;I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if any one eats of this bread, he will live for ever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh.&rdquo; The Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, &ldquo;How can this man give us his flesh to eat?&rdquo; So Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you; he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him. As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats me will live because of me. This is the bread which came down from heaven, not such as the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread&nbsp; will&nbsp; live for&nbsp; ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING</strong><br />
As servants of God we commend ourselves in every way.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the second Letter of Saint Paul to the &nbsp;Corinthians( 2 Corinthians 6: 1- 10)</span><br />
Brethren: Working together with Christ, we entreat you not to accept the grace of God in vain. For he says, &ldquo;At the acceptable time I have listened to you, and helped you on the day of salvation.&rdquo; Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation. We put no obstacle in any one&rsquo;s way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry, but as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: through great endurance, in afflictions, hardships, calamities, beatings, imprisonments, tumults, labours, watching, hunger; by purity, knowledge, forbearance, kindness, the Holy Spirit, genuine love, truthful speech, and the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left; in honour and dishonour, in ill repute and good repute. We are treated as impostors, and yet are true; as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold we live; as punished, and yet not killed; as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing everything.</p>

<p>FIRST READING<br />
For your sake Christ became poor.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the second Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 8: 1-9)</span><br />
We want you to know, brethren, about the grace of God which has been shown in the churches of Macedonia, for in a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of liberality on their part. For they gave according to their means, as I can testify, and beyond their means, of their own free will, begging us earnestly for the favour of taking part in the relief of the saints &mdash; and this, not as we expected, but first they gave themselves&nbsp; to the Lord and to us by the will&nbsp; of God. Accordingly we have urged Titus that as he had already made a beginning, he should also complete among you this gracious work. Now as you excel in everything in faith, in utterance, in knowledge, in all earnestness, and in your&nbsp; love&nbsp; for&nbsp; &nbsp;us &mdash; see that you excel in this gracious work also. I say this not as a command, but to prove by the earnestness of others that your love also is genuine. For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that by his poverty you might become rich.</p>

For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you salute only your brethren, what more are&nbsp; you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>FIRST READING<br />
God loves a cheerful giver.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the second Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 9:6-11)</span><br />
Brethren: He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. Each one must do as he has made up his mind, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to provide you with every blessing in abundance, so that you may always have enough of everything and may provide in abundance for every good work. As it is written, &ldquo;He scatters abroad, he gives to the poor; his righteousness endures for ever.&rdquo; He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your resources and increase the harvest of your &nbsp;righteousness. You will be enriched in every way for great generosity, which through us will produce thanksgiving to God.</p>

At that time: Jesus said to his disciples, &ldquo;Beware of practicing your piety before men in order to be seen by them; for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. Thus, when you give alms, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by men. Truly, I say to you, they have their reward. But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your alms may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you. And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street comers, that they may be seen by men. Truly, I say to you, they have their reward. But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you. &ldquo;And when you fast, do not look dismal, like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by men. Truly, I say to you, they have their reward. But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, that your fasting may not be seen by men but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING</strong><br />
I preached God&rsquo;s Gospel without cost to &nbsp;you.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the second Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 11:1-11)</span><br />
Brethren: I wish you would bear with me in&nbsp; a little&nbsp; foolishness. Do bear with me! I feel a divine jealousy for you, for I betrothed you to Christ to present you as a pure bride to her one husband. But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure&nbsp; devotion&nbsp; to Christ. For if some one comes and preaches another Jesus than the one we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or if you accept a different gospel from the one you accepted, you submit to it readily enough. I think that I am not in the least inferior to these superlative apostles. Even if I am unskilled in speaking, I am not in knowledge; in every way we have made this plain to you in all things. Did I commit a sin in abasing myself so that you might be exalted, because I preached God&rsquo;s gospel without cost to you? I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you. And when I was with you and was in want, I did not burden any one, for my needs were supplied by the brethren who came from Macedonia. So I refrained and will refrain from burdening you in any way. As the truth of Christ is in me, this boast of mine shall not be silenced in the regions of Achaia. And why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!</p>

Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,<br />
on earth as it is in heaven.<br />
Give us this day our daily bread;<br />
And forgive us our trespasses,<br />
as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation,<br />
But deliver us from evil.<br />
For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father also will forgive you; but if you do not forgive men their trespasses neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.&rdquo;</p>

The Lord set his love upon you and chose you.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 7 :5-11)</span><br />
Moses spoke to the people, saying, &ldquo;You are a people holy to the Lord your God; the Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for his own possession, out of all the peoples that are on the face of the earth. It was not because you were more in number than any other people that the Lord set his love upon you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all peoples; but it is because the Lord loves you, and is keeping the oath which he swore to your fathers, that the Lord has brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you from the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. Know therefore that the Lord your God is God, the faithful God who keeps covenant and merciful love with those who&nbsp; &nbsp;love him and keep his commandments, to a thousand generations, and repays to their face those who hate him, by destroying them; he will not be slack with him who hates him, he will repay him to his face. You shall therefore be careful to do the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which I command you this day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>SECOND READING<br />
God loved us.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the first Letter of Saint John (1 John 4:7- 16)</span><br />
Beloved, let us love one another; for love is of God, and he who loves is born of God and knows God. He who does not love does not know God; for God is love. In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only-begotten Son into the world, so that we might live through him. In this is love, not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the expiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought&nbsp; to love one another. No man has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us. By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his own Spirit. And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son as the Saviour of the world. Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. So we know and believe the love God has for us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.</p>

At that time Jesus declared, &ldquo;I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to infants; yes, Father, for such was your gracious will. All things have been delivered to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and any one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. Come to me, all who labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.

<p><strong><span style="color:#ff0000">Vigil Mass of the Birth of John the Baptist (Solemnity)</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Feast: John</span> Prepares the Ways of the Lord. </strong><span style="color:#ff0000">The first reading tells us of a faithful Servant of God, who will be the light of all peoples. There were those who thought that the Baptist has such a light, but John the evangelist clarifies this immediately: &ldquo;He was not the light, but came to testify to the light&rdquo;; &ldquo;the true light, which enlightens everyone&rdquo; (Jn 1:8-9) is Christ. Only Luke describes the birth of the Baptist, while the other evangelists mention him only at the beginning of the public life of Jesus. Luke does so in order to show that with John a new era has dawned: the time of the promises has ended, there is to be no more waiting, the time has begun for such promises to be fulfilled. God has kept his word.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">This Mass is used on the evening of </span>23 June<span style="color:#ff0000">, either before or after First Vespers (Evening Prayer I) of the Solemnity.</span></p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING</strong><br />
Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Jeremiah Jeremiah 1:4- 10</span><br />
In the days of Josiah: The word of the Lord came to me saying, &ldquo;Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.&rdquo; Then I said, &ldquo;Ah, Lord God ! Behold, I do not know how to speak, for I am only a youth.&rdquo; But the Lord said to me, &ldquo;Do not say, &lsquo;I am only a youth&rsquo; ; for to all to whom I send you you shall go, and whatever I command you you shall speak. Be not afraid of them, for I am with you to deliver you, says the Lord.&rdquo; Then the Lord put forth his hand and touched my mouth; and the Lord said to me, &ldquo;Behold, I have put my words in your mouth. See, I have set you this day over nations and over kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.&rdquo;</p>

The prophets searched and inquired about this salvation.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the first Letter of Saint Peter (1 Peter 1 :8- 12)</span><br />
Beloved: Without having seen Jesus Christ, you love him; though you do not now see him you believe in him and rejoice with unutterable and exalted joy. As the outcome of your faith you obtain the salvation of your souls. The prophets who prophesied of the grace that was to be yours searched and inquired about this salvation; they inquired what person or time was indicated by the Spirit of Christ within them when predicting the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glory. It was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you, in&nbsp; the&nbsp; things&nbsp; which&nbsp; have&nbsp; now been announced to you by those who preached the good news to you through the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, things into which angels long to look.</p>

<p>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke(Luke 1 :5-17)<br />
In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, of the division of Abijah; and he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the&nbsp; commandments and ordinances of the Lord blamelessly. But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in years. Now while he was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty, according to the custom of the priesthood, it fell to him by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense. And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense. And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. But the angel said to him, &ldquo;Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer is heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth; for he will be great before the Lord, and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother&rsquo;s womb. And he will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God, and he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the&nbsp; disobedient&nbsp; to the wisdom&nbsp; of the just, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.&rdquo;</p>

Listen to me, O islands, and pay attention, you peoples from afar. The Lord called me from the womb, from the body of my mother he named my name. He made my mouth like a sharp sword, in the shadow of his hand he hid me; he made me a polished arrow, in his quiver he hid me away. And he said to me, &ldquo;You are my servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified.&rdquo; But I said, &ldquo;I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity; yet surely my right is with the Lord, and my recompense with my God.&rdquo; And now the Lord says, who formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob back to him, and that Israel might be gathered to him, for I am honoured in the eyes of the Lord, and my God has become my strength &mdash; he says: &ldquo;It is too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the preserved of Israel; I will give you as a light to the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.</p>

In those days: Paul said, &ldquo;God raised up David to be our fathers&rsquo; king; of whom he testified and said, &lsquo;I have found in David, the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who will do all my will. &rsquo; Of this man&rsquo;s posterity God has brought to Israel a Saviour, Jesus, as he promised. Before his coming John had preached a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. And as John was finishing his course, he said, &lsquo;What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but after me one is coming, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie. &rsquo; &ldquo;Brethren, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you that fear God, to us has been sent the message of this salvation.&rdquo;</p>

And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they would have named him Zechariah after his father, but his mother said, &ldquo;Not so; he shall be called John.&rdquo; And they said to her, &ldquo;None of your kindred is called by this name.&rdquo; And they made signs to his father, inquiring what he would have him called. And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, &ldquo;His name is John.&rdquo; And they all marvelled. And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, blessing God. And fear came on all their neighbours. And all these things were talked about through all the hill country of Judea; and all who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, &ldquo;What then will this child be?&rdquo; For the hand of the Lord was with him. And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness till the day of his manifestation to Israel.</p>

The light of God disturbs those who prefer to live in darkness and they inevitably react by opposition. Persecution often troubled the lives of the prophets. The first reading reminds us of the prophet Jeremiah. In the gospel Jesus says that persecution is a kind of cloak that his disciples will have to wear if they are to be firm in their beliefs. The second reading compares Adam with Christ and confirms that in the struggle between good and evil, good will always triumph.</p>

He has delivered the life of the needy from the hands of evildoers.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 20: 10-13)</span><br />
Jeremiah said: I hear many whispering. Terror is on every side! &ldquo;Denounce him! Let us denounce him!&rdquo; say all my familiar friends, watching for my fall. &ldquo;Perhaps he will be deceived,&nbsp; then&nbsp; we can overcome him, and take our &lsquo;revenge on him.&rdquo; But the Lord is with me as a dread warrior; therefore my persecutors will stumble, they will not overcome me. They will be greatly shamed, for they will not succeed. Their eternal dishonour will never be forgotten. O Lord Of hosts, who test the righteous, who see the heart and the mind, let me&nbsp; see your vengeance&nbsp; upon&nbsp; them,&nbsp; for to you have I committed my cause. Sing to the LORD; praise the LORD! For he has delivered the life of the needy from the hand of evildoers.</p>

God&rsquo;s free gift to us is nothing like our trespass against him.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Romans (Romans 5 :12-15)</span><br />
Brethren: As sin came into the world through one man and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all men sinned&mdash;sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted where .there is no law. Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sins were not like the transgression of Adam, who was a type of the one who was to come. But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if many died through one man&rsquo;s trespass, much more have the grace of God and the free gift in the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for many.</p>

At that time: Jesus said to his apostles, &ldquo;Have no fear of men; for nothing is covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. What I tell you in the dark, utter in the light; and what you hear whispered, proclaim upon the housetops. And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground without your father&rsquo;s will. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows. So everyone who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven; but whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven&rdquo;</p>

Abram went, as the Lord had told him.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Genesis (Genesis 12: 1-9)</span><br />
In those days: The Lord said to Abram, &ldquo;Go from your country and your kindred and your father&rsquo;s house to the land that I will show you. And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and him who curses you will I curse; and by you all the families of the earth shall bless themselves.&rdquo; So Abram went, as the Lord had told him; and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five year old when he departed from Haran. And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother&rsquo;s son, and all their possessions which they had gathered, and the persons that they had gotten in Haran; and they set forth to go to the land of Canaan. When they had come to the land of Canaan, Abram passed through the land to the place at Shechem, to the Oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites were in the land. Then the Lord appeared to Abram, and said, &ldquo;To your descendants I will give this land.&rdquo; So he built there an altar to the Lord, who had appeared to him. Thence he moved to the mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; and there he built an altar to the Lord and called on the name of the Lord. And Abram journeyed on, still going towards the Neged.</p>

<p>FIRST READING<br />
Let there be no strife between you and me, for we are kinsmen.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Genesis (Genesis 13:2.5-18)</span><br />
Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold. And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents, so that the land could not support both of them dwelling together; for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together, and there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram&rsquo;s cattle and the herdsmen of Lot&rsquo;s cattle. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites dwelt in the land. Then Abram said to Lot, &ldquo;Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen; for we are kinsmen. Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I&nbsp; will go the right; or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left.&rdquo; And Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw that the Jordan valley was well watered everywhere like&nbsp; the&nbsp; garden&nbsp; of the&nbsp; LORD,&nbsp; like the land of Egypt, in the direction of Zoar; this was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. So Lot chose for himself all the Jordan valley, and Lot journeyed east; thus they separated from each other. Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, while Lot dwelt among the cities of the valley and moved his tent&nbsp; as&nbsp; far&nbsp; as Sodom. Now the men of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the LORD. The Lord said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, &ldquo;Lift up your eyes, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward; for all the land which you see I will give to you and to your descendants for ever. I will make your descendants as the dust of the earth; so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your descendants also can be counted. Arise, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you.&rdquo; So Abram moved his tent, and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are at Hebron; and there he built an altar to the Lord.</p>

At that time: Jesus said to his disciples, &ldquo;Do not give dogs what is holy; and do not throw your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under foot and turn to attack you. So whatever you wish that men would do to you, do so to them; for this is the law and the prophets. Enter by the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is easy, that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard, that leads to life, and those who find it are few.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING</strong><br />
Abraham believed in God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness(Romans 4. 36),<br />
and the Lord made a covenant with him.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Genesis (Genesis 15:1-12.17-18)</span><br />
In those days: It happened that the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision, &ldquo;Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.&rdquo; But Abram said, &ldquo;O Lord GOD, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Elieze of Damascus?&rdquo; And Abram said, &ldquo;Behold, you have given me no offspring; and a slave born in my house will be my heir.&rdquo; And behold, the word of the Lord came to him, &ldquo;This man shall not be your heir; your own son shall be your heir.&rdquo; And he brought him outside and said, &ldquo;Look towards heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them.&rdquo; Then he said to him, &ldquo;So shall your descendants be.&rdquo; And he believed the Lord; and he reckoned it to him as righteousness. And he said to him, &ldquo;I am the Lord who brought you from Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to possess.&rdquo; But he said, &ldquo;O Lord GOD, how am I to know that I shall possess it?&rdquo; He said to him, &ldquo;Bring me a heifer three years old, a she-goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.&rdquo; And he brought him all these, cut them in two, and laid each half over against the other; but he did not cut the birds in two. And when birds of prey came upon the carcasses, Abram drove them away. As the sun was going down, a deep sleep feel on Abram; and behold, a dread and great darkness fell upon him. When the sun had gone down and it was dark, behold, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces. On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, &ldquo;To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river of Euphrates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The word of the Lord.</p>

At that time: Jesus said to his disciples, &ldquo;Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep&rsquo;s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles? So, every sound tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears evil fruit. A sound tree cannot bear evil fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus you will know them by their fruits.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING</strong><br />
I give you what I have, in the name of Jesus, rise and walk.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles(Acts 3 : I -10)</span><br />
In those days: Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour. And a man lame from birth was being carried, whom they laid daily at that gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask alms of those who entered the temple. Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked for alms. And Peter directed his gaze at him, with John, and said, &ldquo;Look at us.&rdquo; And he fixed his attention upon them, expecting to receive something from them. But Peter said, &ldquo;I have no silver and gold, but I give you what I have; in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise and walk.&rdquo; And he took him by the right hand and raised him up; and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong. And leaping up he stood and walked and entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God. And all the people saw him walking and praising God, and recognised him as the one who sat for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.</p>

<p><strong>SECOND READING</strong><br />
God set me apart before I was born.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Galatians (Galatians 1:11-20)</span><br />
Brethren: I would have you know that the Gospel which was preached by me is not man&rsquo;s gospel. For I did not receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came through a revelation of Jesus Christ. For you have heard of my former life in Judaism, how I persecuted&nbsp; the&nbsp; Church&nbsp; of God violently&nbsp; and tried to&nbsp; destroy it; and I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers. But when he who had set me apart before I was born, and had called me through his grace, was pleased&nbsp; to reveal his&nbsp; Son to me, in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not confer with flesh and blood, nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned to Damascus. Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and remained with him fifteen days. But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord&rsquo;s brother. (In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie!)</p>

<p>The word of the Lord.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">ALLELUIA John 21 .17d</span><br />

Feed my lambs,feed my sheep.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to John (John 21:15-19)</span><br />
When [Jesus had revealed himself to his disciples and] they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, &ldquo;Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?&rdquo; He said to him, &ldquo;Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.&rdquo; He said to him, &ldquo;Feed my lambs.&rdquo; A second time he said to him, &ldquo;Simon, son of John, do you love me?&rdquo; He said to him, &ldquo;Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.&rdquo; He said to him, &ldquo;Tend my sheep.&rdquo; He said to him the third time, &ldquo;Simon, son of John, do you love me?&rdquo; Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, &ldquo;Do you love me?&rdquo; And he said to him, &ldquo;Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Feed my sheep. Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you fastened your own belt and walked where you would; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will fasten your belt for you and bring you where you do not wish to go.&rdquo; (This he said to show by what death he was to glorify God.) And after this he said to him, &ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>FIRST READING<br />
Now I am sure that the Lord has rescued me from the hand of Herod.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 12: 1- 11)</span><br />
In those days: Herod the king laid violent hands upon some who belonged to the Church. He killed James the brother of John with the sword; and when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during the days of Unleavened Bread. And when he had seized him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people. So Peter was kept in prison; but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the Church. The very night when Herod was about to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison;&nbsp; and behold,&nbsp; an angel of the Lord appeared, and a light shone in the cell; and he struck Peter on the side and woke him, saying, &ldquo;Get up quickly.&rdquo; And the chains fell off his hands. And the angel said to him, &ldquo;Dress yourself and put on your sandals.&rdquo; And he did so. And he said to him, &ldquo;Wrap your cloak around you and follow me.&rdquo; And he went out and followed him; he did not know that what was done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision. When they had passed the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. It opened to them of its own accord, and they went out and passed on through one street; and immediately the angel left him. And Peter came to himself, and said, &ldquo;Now I am sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The word of the Lord.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the second Letter of Saint Paul to Timothy(2 Timothy 4:6-8, 17- 18)</span><br />
Beloved: I am already on the point of being sacrificed; the time of my departure has come. I have fought the good fight, I have&nbsp;&nbsp; finished the race, I have kept the faith. From now on there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me on that Day, and not only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing. But the Lord stood by me and gave me strength to proclaim the word fully, that all the Gentiles might hear it. So I was rescued from the lion&rsquo;s mouth. The Lord will rescue me from every evil and save me for his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Genesis (Genesis 17:1.9-10.15-22)</span><br />
When Abram was ninety-nine years old the Lord appeared to Abram, and said to him, &ldquo;I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless.&rdquo; And God said to Abraham, &ldquo;As for you, you shall keep my covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their generations. This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your descendants after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised.&rdquo; And God said to Abraham, &ldquo;As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name. I will bless her, and moreover I will give you a son by her; I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of peoples shall come from her.&rdquo; Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said to himself, &ldquo;Shall a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?&rdquo; And Abraham said to God, &ldquo;O that Ishmael might live in your sight!&rdquo; God said, &ldquo;No, but Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him. As for Ishmael, I have heard you; behold, I will bless him and make him fruitful and multiply him exceedingly; he shall be the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation. But I will establish my covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this season next year.&rdquo; When he had finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham.</p>

<p>FIRST READING<br />
Is anything too hard for the Lord? At the appointed time I will return to you, and Sarah shall have a son.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Genesis (Genesis 18:1-15)</span><br />
<br />
In those days: The Lord appeared to Abraham by the Oaks of Mamre, as he sat at the door of his tent in the heat of the day. He lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, three men stood in front of him. When he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them, and bowed himself to the earth, and said, &ldquo;My lord, if I have found favour in your sight, do not pass by your servant. Let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree, while I fetch a morsel of bread, that you may refresh yourselves, and after that you may pass on - since you have come to your servant.&rdquo; So they said, &ldquo;Do as you have said.&rdquo; And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, &ldquo;Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.&rdquo; And Abraham ran to the herd, and took a calf, tender and good, and gave it to the servant, who hastened to prepare it. Then he took curds, and milk, and the calf which he had prepared, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree while they ate. They said to him, &ldquo;Where is Sarah your wife?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;She is in the tent.&rdquo; The Lord said, &ldquo;I will surely return to you in the spring, and Sarah your wife shall have a son.&rdquo; And Sarah was listening at the tent door behind him. Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. So Sarah laughed to herself, saying; &ldquo;After I have grown old, and my husband is old, shall I have pleasure?&rdquo; The Lord said to Abraham, &ldquo;Why did Sarah laugh, and say, &lsquo;Shall I indeed bear a child, now that I am old?&rsquo; Is anything too hard for the Lord? At the appointed time I will return to you, in the spring, and Sarah shall have a son.&rdquo; But Sarah denied, saying, I did not laugh&rdquo;; for she was afraid. He said, &ldquo;No, but you did laugh.&rdquo;</p>

Many will come from east and west and sit at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew (Matthew 8:5-17)</span><br />
<br />
At that time: As Jesus entered Capernaum, a centurion came forward to him, begging him and saying, Lord, my servant is lying paralysed at home, in terrible distress.&rdquo; And he said to him, I will come and heal him.&rdquo; But the centurion answered him, Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof; but only say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I am a man under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to one, &lsquo;Go,&rsquo; and he goes, and to another, Come, and he comes, and to my slave,Do this,&rsquo; and he does it.&rdquo; When Jesus heard him, he marvelled, and said to those who followed him, &ldquo;Truly, I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such faith. I tell you, many will come from east and west and sit at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, while the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness; there men will weep and quash their teeth.&rdquo; And to the centurion Jesus said, &ldquo;Go; let it be done for you as you have believed.&rdquo; And the servant was healed at that very moment. And when Jesus entered Peter&rsquo;s house, he saw his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever; he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she rose and served him. That evening they brought to him many who were possessed with demons; and he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick. This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, &ldquo;He took our infirmities and bore our diseases.&rdquo;</p>

<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the second Book of Kings (2 Kings 4:8-11.14-16a)</span></p>

<p>One day Elisha went on to Shunem, where a wealthy woman lived, who urged him to eat some food. So whenever he passed that way, he would turn in there to eat food. And she said to her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, who is continually passing our way. Let us make a small roof chamber with walls, and put there for him a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp, so that whenever he comes to us, he can go in there. One day he came there, and he turned into the chamber and rested there. And he said to Gehazi his servant, What is to be done for her?&rdquo; Gehazi answered, &ldquo;Well, she has no son, and her husband is old.&rdquo;He said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door way. And he said, &ldquo;At this season, when the time comes round, you shall embrace a son.</p>

Having been buried with him by baptism, let us walk in newness of life.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Romans (Romans 6:3-4.8-11)</span></p>

<p>Brethren: All of us who have been baptised into Christ Jesus were baptised into his death. We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. But if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him. For we know that Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. The death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>At that time: Jesus said to his apostles, He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; and he who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake will find it. He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me. He who receives a prophet because he is a prophet shall receive a prophet&rsquo;s reward, and he who receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man shall receive a righteous man&rsquo;s reward. And whoever gives to one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple, truly, I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.</p>

The Lord God rained brimstone and fire on Sodom and Gomorrah.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Genesis (Genesis 19:15-29)</span></p>

<p>In those days: The angels urged Lot, saying, &rdquo;Arise, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the punishment of Sodom.&rdquo; But he lingered; so the men seized him and his wife and his two daughters by the hand, the Lord being merciful to him, and they brought him forth and set him outside the city. And when they had brought them forth, they said, flee for your life; do not back or stop anywhere in the valley; flee to the hills, lest you be consumed. And Lot said to them, &ldquo;Oh, no, my Lord; behold, your servant has found favour in your sight, and you have shown me great kindness in saving my life; but I cannot flee to the hills, lest the disaster overtake me, and I die. Behold, yonder city is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one. Let me escape there-is it not little one? - and my life will be saved! He said to him, Behold, I grant you this favour also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken. Make haste, escape there; for I can do nothing until you arrive there. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar. The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar. Then the Lord rained on Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven; and he overthrew those cities, and all the valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground. But Lot&rsquo;s wife behind him looked back, and she became a pillar of salt. And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the Lord; and he looked down towards Sodom and Gomorrah and towards all the land the valley, and beheld, and behold, the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace. So it was that, when God destroyed the cities of the valley, God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrow the cities in which Lot dwelt.</p>

The son of this slave woman shall not be heir with my son Isaac.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Genesis (Genesis 21:5.8-20)</span></p>

<p>Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. And the child grew, and was weaned; and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.&nbsp; But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, playing with her son Isaac. So she said to Abraham, &ldquo;Cast out this slave woman with her son; for the son of this slave woman shall not be heir with my son Isaac.&rdquo; And the thing was very displeasing to Abraham on account of his son. But God said to Abraham, &ldquo;Be not displeased because of the lad and because of your slave woman; whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you, for through Isaac shall your descendants be named. And I will make a nation of the son of the slave woman also, because he is your offspring.&rdquo; So Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, along with the child, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba. When the water in the skin was gone, she cast the child under one of the bushes. Then she went, and sat down over against him a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot; for she said, &ldquo;Let me not look upon the death of the child.&rdquo; And as she sat over against him, the child lifted up his voice and wept. And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven, and said to her, &ldquo;What troubles you, Hagar? Fear not; for God has heard the voice of the lad where he is. Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him fast with your hand; for I will make him a great nation.&rdquo; Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the skin with water, and gave the lad a drink. And God was with the lad, and he grew up; he lived in the wilderness, and became an expert with the bow.</p>

And the demons begged him, If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of swine. And he said to them, Go. So they came out and went into the swine; and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and perished in the waters. The herdsmen fled, and going into the city they told everything, and what had happened to the demoniacs.

<p>In those days: God tested Abraham, and said to him, &ldquo;Abraham!&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Here am I.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Take your son, your only- begotten son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering upon one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.&rdquo; So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac; and he cut the wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him. On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off. Then Abraham said to his young men, &ldquo;Stay here with the donkey; I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.&rdquo; And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it on Isaac his son; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So they went both of &nbsp;them together. And Isaac said to his father Abraham, &ldquo;My father!&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Here am I, my son.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Behold, the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?&rdquo; Abraham said, &ldquo;God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.&rdquo; &nbsp;So they went both of them together. When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built an altar there, and &nbsp;laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his&nbsp;&nbsp; son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood. Then Abraham put forth &nbsp;his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. But the angel of the Lord called to him from &nbsp;heaven, and said, &ldquo;Abraham, Abraham!&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Here am I.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Do not lay your hand on the lad or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only-begotten son, from me.&rdquo; And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns; and Abraham &nbsp;went and took the ram, and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of &nbsp;his son. So Abraham called the name of that place The Lord will provide; as it is said to this day, &ldquo;On the mount of &nbsp;the Lord it shall be provided.&rdquo; And the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven, &nbsp;and said, &nbsp;&ldquo;By myself I have sworn, says the Lord, because you have done this, and have not withheld your son, your only-begotten son, I will indeed bless you, and I will multiply your descendants as the stars of &nbsp;heaven and as the sand which is on the seashore. And your descendants shall possess the gate of their enemies, and by your descendants shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves, because you have obeyed my voice.&rdquo; So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.</p>

And Sarah died at Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) &nbsp;in the land of Canaan; and Abraham went in to mourn&nbsp; for Sarah and to weep for her. And Abraham rose up from before his dead, and said to the Hittites, &ldquo;I am a stranger and a sojourner among you; give me property among you for a burying place, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.&rdquo; After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah east of Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan. Now Abraham&nbsp; was old,&nbsp; well advanced in years; and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things. And Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his house, who had charge of all that he had, &ldquo;Put your hand under my thigh, &nbsp;and I will make you swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and of &nbsp;the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daugh ters of &nbsp;the Canaanites, among whom I dwell, but will go to rriy country and to my kindred, and take a wife for my &nbsp;son Isaac.&rdquo; The servant said to him, &ldquo;Perhaps the woman &nbsp;may not be willing to follow me to this land; must I then take your son back to the land from which you came?&rdquo; Abraham said to him, &ldquo;See to it that you do not take my son back there. Thc Lord, the God of heaven, who took me from my father&rsquo;s house and from the land of my birth, and who spoke to me and swore to me, &lsquo;To your descendants I will give this land, &rsquo;he will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there. But if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be free from this oath of mine; only you must not take my son back there.&rdquo; &nbsp;When &nbsp;the servant returned with Rebekah, &nbsp;Isaac was dwelling in the Negeb. &nbsp;And Isaac went out to meditate in the field in the evening; and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, there were camels coming. And Rebekah &nbsp;lifted up her eyes, and&nbsp; when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel, &nbsp;and said to the servant, &ldquo;Who is the man yonder, walking in the field to meet us?&rdquo; The servant said, &ldquo;It is my master.&rdquo; So she took her veil and covered herself. And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done. Then Isaac brought her into the tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her.

<span style="color:#ff0000">A readings from the holy Gospel according to Matthew (Matthew 9:9-13)</span></p>

<p>At that time: As Jesus passed on, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax office; and he said to him, Follow me. And he rose and followed him. And as he sat at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples. And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners? But when he heard it, he said, Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. Go and learn what this means, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice. For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.</p>

<p>FIRST READING<br />
Jacob supplanted his brother&rsquo;s place and took away his blessing (27.36).<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Genesis (Genesis 27:1-5.15-29)</span></p>

<p>When Isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see, he called Esau his older son, and said to him, &ldquo;My son.&rdquo; And he answered, &ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Behold, I am old; I do not know the day of my death. Now then, take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and hunt game for me, and prepare for me savoury food, such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat; that I may bless you before I die.&rdquo; Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau. And Esau went&nbsp; to the field to hunt for game and bring it. Then Rebekah took the best garments of Esau her older son. which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son; and the skins of the kids [which Jacob had brought to hell she put upon his hands and upon the smooth part of his neck; and she gave the savoury food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son, Jacob. So he went in to his father, and said, &ldquo;My father.&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Here I am; who are you, my son?&rdquo; Jacob said to his father, &ldquo;I am Esau your first-born. I have done as you told me; now sit up and eat of my game, that you may bless me.&rdquo; But Isaac said to his son, &ldquo;How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Because the Loan your God granted me success.&rdquo; Then Isaac said to Jacob, &ldquo;Come near, that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Esau or not.&rdquo; So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, who felt him and said, &ldquo;The voice is Jacob&rsquo;s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.&rdquo; And he did not recognise him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau&rsquo;s hands; so he blessed him. He said, &ldquo;Are you really my son Esau?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;Bring it to me, that I may eat of my son&rsquo;s game and bless you.&rdquo; So he brought it to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank. Then his father Isaac said to him, &ldquo;Come near and kiss me, my son.&rdquo; So he came near and kissed him; and he smelled the smell of his garments, and blessed him, and said, &ldquo;See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the Loan has blessed! May God give you of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and wine. Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, and may your mother&rsquo;s sons bow down to you. Cursed be every one who curses you, and blessed be every one who blesses you!&rdquo;</p>

Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them?<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew (Matthew 9:14-17)</span></p>

<p>At that time: The disciples of John came to Jesus, saying, &ldquo;Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?&rdquo; And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The days will come, when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast. And no one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch tears away from the garment, and a worse tear is made. Neither is new wine put into old wineskins; if it is, the skins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the skins are destroyed; but new wine is put into fresh wineskins, and so both are preserved.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Entrance Antiphon&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cf.Ps47:10-il</span><br />
Your merciful love, O God, we have received in the midst of your temple. Your praise, O God, like your name, reaches the ends of the earth. Your right hand is filled with saving justice.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Collect</span><br />
O God, who in the abasement of your Son have raised up a fallen world, fill your faithful with holy joy, for on those you have rescued from slavery to sin you bestow eternal gladness. Through our Lord...</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Sunday:</span> <em>God Reveals Himself to the Poor</em>. The gospel shows Jesus &ldquo;gentle and humble, that is, on the side of the poor and the oppressed. He rejoices because it is to them that the father has revealed his message of salvation. In the first reading we find the words of the prophet announcing a Messiah who is poor and humble. These appear to be words that describe Jesus. The second reading can be linked to this theme because it speaks of the Spirit who can only be received by the poor, by those who are humble in heart.</p>

<hr />
<p>FIRST READING<br />
Behold, your king comes to you, humble.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of the Prophet Zechariah (Zechariah 9:9-10)</span></p>

<p>Thus says the Lord: Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king comes to you; triumphant and victorious is he, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt the foal of a donkey. I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the war horse from Jerusalem; and the battle bow shall be cut off, and he shall command peace to the nations; his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.</p>

<p>SECOND READING<br />
If by the spirit you put to death the deeds of the body you will live.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Romans (Roman 8:9.11-13)</span></p>

<p>Brethren: you are not in the flesh, you are in the spirit, if the spirit of God really dwells in you. Any one who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his spirit who dwells in you. So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh &ndash; for if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the spirit you put to death the deeds of the body you will live.</p>

<p>The word of the Lord.</p>

<p>At that time Jesus declared, I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to infants; yes, Father, for such was your gracious will all things have been delivered to me by my father; and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and any one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. Come to me, all who labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</p>

<p>FIRST READING<br />
He caw a ladder set up, and the angels of God ascending and descending, and trod speaking.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Genesis (Genesis 28:10-22a)</span></p>

<p>In those days: Jacob left Beersheba, and went towards Haran. And he came to a certain place, and stayed there that night, because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place to sleep. And he dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven; and behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it! And behold, the Lord stood above it and said, I am the Lord, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie I will give to you and to your descendants; and your descendants shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south; and by you and your descendants shall all the families of the earth bless themselves. Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done that of which I have spoken to you.&rdquo; Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, Surely the Lord is in this place; and I did not know it. And he was afraid, and said, How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.&rdquo; So Jacob rose early in the morning, and he took the stone which he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it. He called the name of that place Bethel; but the name of the city was Luz at the first. Then Jacob made a vow, saying, &ldquo;If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear, so that I come again to my father&rsquo;s house in peace, then the Lord shall be my God, and this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>At that time: While Jesus was speaking, behold, a ruler came in and knelt before him, saying, My daughter has just died; but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live. And Jesus rose and followed him, with his disciples. And behold, a woman who had suffered from a haemorrhage for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment; for she said to herself, If I only touch his garment, I shall be made well. Jesus turned, and seeing her he said, Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well.&rdquo; And instantly the woman was made well. And when Jesus came to the ruler&rsquo;s house, and saw the flute players, and the crowd making a tumult, he said, Depart; for the girl is not dead but sleeping. And they laughed at him. But when the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose. And the report of this went through all that district.</p>

Your name shall be called Israel, for you have striven with God and have prevailed<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Genesis (Genesis 32:23-32)</span></p>

<p>In those days: Jacob arose at night and took his two wives, his two maids, and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. He took them and sent them across the stream, and like wise everything that he had. And Jacob was left alone; and a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day. When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and jacob&rsquo;s thigh was put out of joint as he wrestled with him. Then he said, &ldquo;let me go, for the day is breaking,&rdquo; but Jacob said, &ldquo;I will not let you go, unless you bless me.&rdquo; And he said to him, &ldquo;what is your name?&rdquo; and he said, &ldquo;Jacob.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;Your name shall no more be called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed.&rdquo; Then Jacob asked him, &ldquo;tell me, I pray, your name.&rdquo; but he said, &ldquo;Why is it that you ask my name?&rdquo; and there he blessed him. So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, saying, &ldquo;for I have seen God face to face, and yet my life is preserved.&rdquo; The sun rose upon him as he passed Penuel, limping because of his thigh. Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, because he touched the hollow of Jacob&rsquo;s thigh on the sinew of the hip.</p>

We are guilty concerning our brother; therefore is this distress come upon us.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Genesis (Genesis 41:55-57; 42:5-7a. 17-24a)</span></p>

<p>In those days: when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, &ldquo;Go to Joseph; what he says to you, do.&rdquo; So when the famine had spread over all the land, joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt. Moreover, all the earth came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe over all the earth. Thus the sons of Israel came to Egypt to buy among the others who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan. Now Joseph was governor over the land; he it was who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph&rsquo;s brothers came, and bowed themselves before him with their faces to the ground. Joseph saw his brothers, and knew them, but he treated them like strangers and spoke roughly to them. And he put them all together in prison for three days. On the third day Joseph&nbsp; said to them, &ldquo;Do this and you will live, for I fear God: if you are honest men, let one of your brothers remain confined in your prison, and let the rest go and carry grain for the famine of your households, and bring your youngest brother to me; so your words will be verified, and you shall not die.&rdquo; And they did so. Then they said to one another, &ldquo;in truth we are guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he besought us and we would not listen; therefore is this distress come upon us.&rdquo; And Reuben answered them, &ldquo;Did I not tell you not to sin against the lad? But you would not listen. So now there comes a reckoning for his blood.&rdquo; They did not know that joseph understood them, for there was an interpreter between them. Then he turned away from them and wept.</p>

God sent me before you to preserve life,<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Genesis (Genesis 44:18-21.23b-29;45:1-5)</span></p>

<p>In those days: Judah went up to Joseph and said, &ldquo;O my lord, &nbsp;let your servant, I beg you, speak a word in my lord&rsquo;s ears, and let not your anger burn against your servant; for you are like Pharaoh himself. My lord asked his servants, saying, &lsquo;Have you a father, or a brother?&rsquo; And we said to my lord, &lsquo;We have a father, an old man, and a young brother, the &nbsp;child of his old age; and his brother is dead, and heal one is left of his mother&rsquo;s children; and his father loves him.&rsquo; Then you said to your servants, &lsquo;Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes upon&nbsp; him. Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall see my face no more.&rsquo; &nbsp;When we went back to your servant my father we told him the words of my lord. And when our father said, &lsquo;Go again, buy us a little food,&rsquo; we said, &lsquo;We cannot go down. If our youngest brother goes with us, then we will go down; for we cannot see the man&rsquo;s face unless our youngest brother is with us.&rsquo; &nbsp;Then your servant my father said to us, &lsquo;You know that my wife bore me two sons; one left me, and I said, Surely he has been torn to pieces; and I have never seen him since. If you take this one also from me, and harm befalls him, you will bring down my grey hairs in sorrow to Sheol.&rdquo;&rsquo; Then Joseph could not control himself before all those who stood by him; and he cried, &ldquo;Make every one go out from me.&rdquo; So no one stayed with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers. And he wept aloud, so that the Egyptians heard it, and the household of &nbsp;Pharaoh heard it. And Joseph said to his brothers, &ldquo;I am Joseph; is my father still alive?&rdquo; But his brothers could not answer him, for they were dismayed at his presence. So Joseph said to his brothers, &ldquo;Come near to me, I beg you.&rdquo; And they came near. And he said, &ldquo;I &nbsp;am your brother, Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt. And now do not be distressed, or angry with yourselves, because you sold me here; for God sent me before you to preserve life.&rdquo;</p>

You received without pay, give without pay. Take no gold, nor silver, nor copper in your belts, no bag for your journey, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor a staff; for the labourer deserves his food. And whatever town or village you enter, find out who is worthy in it, and stay with him until &nbsp;&nbsp;you depart. As you enter the house, salute it. And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you. And if any one will not receive you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet as you leave that house or town. Truly, I say to you, it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgement for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>FIRST READING<br />
Now let me die, since I have seen your face.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Genesis&nbsp; (Genesis 46: 1-7.2b-30)</span></p>

<p>In those days: Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. And God spoke to Israel in visions of the night, and said, &ldquo;Jacob, Jacob.&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Here am I.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;I am God, the God of your father; do not be afraid to go down to Egypt; for I will there make of you a great nation. I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also bring you up again; and Joseph&rsquo;s hand shall close your eyes.&rdquo; Then Jacob set out from Beersheba; and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. They also took their cattle and their goods, which they had gained in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob and all his offspring with him, his sons, and his sons&rsquo; sons with him, his daughters, and his sons&rsquo; daughters; all his offspring he brought with him into Egypt. He sent Judah before him to Joseph, to appear before him in Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. Then Joseph made ready his chariot and went up to meet Israel his father in Goshen; and he presented himself to him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. Israel said to Joseph, &ldquo;Now let me die, since I have seen your face and know that you are still alive.</p>

<p>At that time: Jesus said to his apostles, Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves; so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. Beware of men; for they will deliver you up to councils, and flog you in their synagogues, and you will be dragged before governors and kings for my sake, to bear testimony before them and the Gentiles. When they deliver you up, do not be anxious about how you are to speak or what you are to say; for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour; for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death; and you will be hated by all for my name&rsquo;s sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved. When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next; for truly, I say to you, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel, before the Son of man comes.</p>

<p>FIRST READING<br />
God will visit you, and bring you up out of this land.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Genesis (Genesis 49:29-33;50:15-26a)</span></p>

<p>In those days: Jacob&nbsp; charged his&nbsp; sons, and said to them,&nbsp; &ldquo;I am to&nbsp; be gathered to my people; bury me&nbsp; with&nbsp; my&nbsp; fathers&nbsp; in the&nbsp; cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, in the cave that&nbsp; is in the&nbsp; field at Machpelah, to the east of Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to possess as a burying place. There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah &mdash; the field and the cave that is in it were purchased from the Hittites.&rdquo; When Jacob finished charging his sons, he drew up his feet into the bed, and breathed his last, and was gathered to his people. When Joseph&rsquo;s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, &ldquo;It may be that Joseph will hate us and pay us back for all the evil which we did to him.&rdquo; So they sent a message to Joseph, saying, &ldquo;Your father gave this command before he died, &lsquo;Say to Joseph, Forgive, I pray you, the transgression of your brothers and their sin, because they did evil to you. &rsquo; And now, we beg you, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.&rdquo; Joseph wept when they spoke to him. His brothers also came and fell down before him, and said, &ldquo;Behold, we are your servants.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Joseph said to them, &ldquo;Fear not, for am I in the place of God?&nbsp; As for you, you meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are today. So do not fear; I will provide for you and your little ones.&rdquo; Then he reassured them and comforted them. So Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father&rsquo;s house; and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years. And Joseph saw Ephraim&rsquo;s children of the third generation; the children also of Machirthe son of Manasseh were born upon Joseph&rsquo;s knees. And Joseph said to his brothers, &ldquo;I am about to die; but God will visit you, and bring you up out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.&rdquo; Then Joseph took an oath of the sons of Israel, saying, &ldquo;God will visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.&rdquo; So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old.</p>

Do not fear those who kill the body.<br />

<p>At that time: Jesus said to his apostles, &ldquo;A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master; it is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they malign those of his household. So have no fear of them; for nothing is covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. What I tell you in the dark, utter in the light; and what you hear whispered, proclaim up on the housetops. And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father&rsquo;s will. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows. So every one who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven; but whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven.</p>

Today&rsquo;s Rosary: The Glorious Mystery</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Sunday:</span><em> An Abundant Harvest from Difficult Soil.</em> We are accustomed to seeing the effects of Advertising. When youngsters see ways of dressing or combing their hair in films or on TV, they imitate them. Why is the Gospel so slow in entering our hearts? This question is answered by today&rsquo;s readings. The Gospel tells us it depends on the soil. Jesus assures us that even the most barren soil cannot long resist the penetrating force of the seed. The first reading strengthens this idea and compares the word of God to the rain that brings life. The second reading tells us that sowing is always difficult, it is a time of pain, though not the pain of death, merely the beginning of new life.</p>

<hr />
<p>FIRST READING<br />
The rain makes the earth fruitful.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Isaiah (Isaiah 55: 10-11)</span></p>

<p>Thus says the Lord: As the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return there but water the earth, making it bring forth and sprout, giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater, so shall my word be that goes forth from my mouth; it shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I intend, and prosper in the thing for which I sent it.</p>

<p>The word of the Lord.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">RESPONSORIAL&nbsp; PSALM Ps 65:9abcd.9e- 10.11- 12.13 (R. Lk5:Sa)</span><br />
<strong><span style="color:#ff0000">R</span>.The seed that fell into good soil yielded a hundredfold.</strong></p>

<p>You visit the earth, give it water;<br />
You fill it with riches.<br />
God&rsquo;s ever-flowing river brims over<br />
to prepare the grain.<span style="color:#ff0000"> R.</span></p>

<p>And thus you provide for the earth:<br />
you drench its furrows;<br />
you level it, soften it with showers;<br />
you bless its growth. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p>You crown they ear with your bounty.<br />
Abundance flows in your pathways;<br />
in pastures of the desert it flows.<span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p>The hills are girded with joy.<br />
The meadows clothed with flocks.<br />
The valleys are decked with wheat.<br />
They shout for joy; yes, they sing! <span style="color:#ff0000">R</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>SECOND READING<br />
All creation is waiting for the revelation of the sons of God.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Letter of Saint, Paul to the Romans (Romans 8:18-23)</span></p>

<p>Brethren: I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us. For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God; for the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will but by the will of him who subjected it in hope; because the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the glorious liberty of the children of God. We know that the whole creation has been groaning with labour pains together until now; and not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.</p>

<p>The word of the Lord.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">ALLELUIA</span><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>GOSPEL<br />
A sower went out to sow.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew (Matthew 13: 1-23)</span></p>

<p>* That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea. And great crowds gathered about him, so that he got into a boat and sat there; and the whole crowd stood on the beach. And he told them many things in parables, saying: &ldquo;A Sower went out to sow. And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them. Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they had not much soil, and immediately they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil, but when the sun rose they were scorched; and since they had no root they withered away. Other seeds fell upon thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them. Other seeds fell on good soil and brought forth grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. He who has ears, let him hear.&rdquo; *<br />
Then the disciples came and said to him, &ldquo;Why do you speak to them in parables?&rdquo; And he answered them, &ldquo;To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. For to him who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away. This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand. With them indeed is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says: &lsquo;You shall indeed hear but never understand, and you shall indeed see but never perceive. For this people&rsquo;s heart has grown dull, and their ears are heavy of hearing, and their eyes they have closed, lest they should perceive&nbsp; with their&nbsp; eyes,&nbsp; and&nbsp; hear with their ears, and understand with their&nbsp; heart,&nbsp; and turn&nbsp; for me to heal them. &rsquo; But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear. Truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it. &ldquo;Hear then the parable of the sower. When any one hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what is sown in his heart; this is what was sown along the path. As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy; yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately he falls away. As for what was sown among thorns, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the delight in riches choke the word, and it proves unfruitful. As for what was sown on good soil, this is he who hears the word and understands it; he indeed bears fruit, and yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty.</p>

<p>FIRST READING<br />
Let us deal shrewdly with Israel, lest they multiply.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Exodus (Exodus 1 :8-14.22)</span></p>

<p>In those days: there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph. And he said to his people, &ldquo;Behold, the sons of Israel are too many and too mighty for us. Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, lest they multiply, and, if war befall us, they join our enemies and fight against us and escape from the land.&rdquo; Therefore they set task masters over them to afflict them with heavy burdens; and they built for Pharaoh store-cities, Pithomand Ra-amses. But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad. And the Egyptians were in dread of the sons of Israel. So they made the people of Israel serve with rigour, and made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and brick, and in all kinds of work in the field; in all their work they made them serve with rigor. And Pharaoh commanded all his people, &ldquo;Every son that is born to the Hebrews you shall cast into the Nile, but you shall let every daughter live.</p>

<p>At that time: Jesus said to his apostles, &ldquo;Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and a man&rsquo;s foes will be those of his own household. He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; and he who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake will find it. He who receives you received me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me. He who receives a prophet because he is a prophet shall receive a prophet&rsquo;s reward, and he who receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man shall receive a righteous man&rsquo;s reward.&nbsp; And whoever gives to one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple, truly, I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.&rdquo; And when Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities.</p>

<p>FIRST READING<br />
She named him Moses, for she said, Because I drew him out of the water&rdquo;; and when he had grown up, he went out to his people.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Exodus (Exodus2:1-15a)</span></p>

<p>In those days: A man from the house of Levi went and took to wife a daughter of Levi. The woman conceived and bore a son; and when she saw that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months. And when she could hide him no longer she took for him a basket made of bulrushes, and daubed it with bitumen and pitch; and she put the child in it and placed it among the reeds at the river&rsquo;s brink. And his sister stood at a distance, to know what would be done to him. Now the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, and her maidens walked beside the river; she saw the basket among the reeds and sent her maid to fetch it. When she opened it she saw the child; and behold, the baby was crying. She took pity on him and said, &ldquo;This is one of the Hebrews&rsquo; children.&rdquo; Then his sister said to Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter, &ldquo;Shall I go and call you a nurse from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?&rdquo; And Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter said to her, &ldquo;Go.&rdquo; So the girl went and called the child&rsquo;s mother. And Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter said to her, &ldquo;Take this child away, and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.&rdquo; So the woman took the child and nursed him. And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter, and he became her son; and she named him Moses, for she said, &ldquo;Because I drew him out of the water.&rdquo; One day, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his people and looked on their burdens; and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his people. He looked this way and that, and seeing no one he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. When he went out the next day, behold, two Hebrews were struggling together; and he said to the man that did the wrong, &ldquo;Why do you strike your fellow?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?&rdquo; Then Moses was afraid, and thought, &ldquo;Surely the thing is known.&rdquo; &nbsp;When Pharaoh heard of it, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh, and stayed in the land of Midian.</p>

<p>At that time: Jesus began to upbraid the cities where most of his mighty works had been done, because they did not repent. &ldquo;Woe to you, Chorazin! woe to you, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I tell you, it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgement for Tyre and Sidon than for you. And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You shall be brought down to Hades. For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. But I tell you that it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgement for the land of Sodom than for you.&rdquo;</p>

The angel of the Lord appeared to Moses in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Exodus (Exodus 3:1-6.9-12)</span></p>

<p>In those days: Moses was keeping the flock of his father-in-law, Jethro, the priest of Midian; and he led his flock to the west side of the wilderness, and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. And the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush; and he looked, and behold, the bush was burning, yet it was not consumed. And Moses said, &ldquo;I will turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.&rdquo; When the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the bush, &ldquo;Moses, Moses!&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Here am I.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;Do not come near; put off your shoes from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&rdquo; And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God. The Lord said, &ldquo;Now, behold, the cry of the sons of Israel has come to me, and I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them. Come, I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring forth my people, the sons of Israel, out of Egypt.&rdquo; But Moses said to God, &ldquo;Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and bring the sons of Israel out of Egypt?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;But I will be with you; and this shall be the sign for you, that I have sent you: when you have brought forth the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God upon this mountain.</p>

You shall kill the lamb in the evening, and I will pass over you.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Exodus (Exodus 11:10-12:l4)</span></p>

<p>In those days: Moses and Aaron did many wonders before Pharaoh; and the Lord hardened Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart, and he did not let the sons of Israel go out of his land. The Lord said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, &ldquo;This month shall be for you the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year for you. Tell all the congregation of Israel that on the tenth day of this month they shall take every man a lamb according to their fathers&rsquo; houses, a lamb for a household; and if the household is too small for a lamb, then a man and his neighbour next to his house shall take according to the number of persons; according to what each can eat you shall make your count for the lamb. Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old; you shall take it from the sheep or from the goats; and you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month, when the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill their lambs in the evening. Then they shall take some of the blood, and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses in which they eat them. They shall eat the flesh that night, roasted; with unleavened bread and bitter herbs they shall eat it. Do not eat any of it raw or, boiled with water, but roasted, its head with its legs and its inner parts. And you shall let none of it remain until the morning, anything that remains until the morning you shall bum. In this manner you shall eat it: your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste. It is the Lord&rsquo;s Passover. For I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and on a1l, the gods of Egypt I will execute judgements: I am the Lord. The blood shall be a sign for you, upon the houses where you are; and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague shall fall upon you to destroy you, when I strike the land of Egypt. This day shall be for you a memorial day, and you shall keep it as a feast to the Lord; throughout your generations you shall observe it as an ordinance for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that time Jesus went through the grain fields on the sabbath; his disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat. But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, &ldquo;Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the sabbath.&rdquo; He said to them, &ldquo;Have you not read what David did, when he was hungry, and those who were with him: how he entered the house of God and&nbsp; ate&nbsp; the&nbsp; showbread,&nbsp; which&nbsp; it&nbsp; was&nbsp; not&nbsp; lawful for him to eat nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests? Or have you not read in the law how on the sabbath the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are guiltless? I tell you, something greater than, the temple is here. And if you had known what this means, &lsquo;I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,&rsquo; you would not have condemned the guiltless. For the Son of man is lord of the sabbath.</p>

<p>Brethren: The love of Christ urges us on, because we are convinced that one has died for all; therefore all have died. And he died for all, that those who live might live no longer for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised. From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh; even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus no longer. Therefore, if any one is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has passed away, behold, the new his come.</p>

<p>Now on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb. So she ran, and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, &ldquo;They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.&rdquo; But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb; and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet. They said to her, &ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping?&rdquo; She said to them, &ldquo;Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.&rdquo; Saying this, she turned round and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping? Whom do you seek?&rdquo; Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, &ldquo;Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.&rdquo; Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Mary.&rdquo; She turned and said to him in Hebrew, &ldquo;Rabboni!&rdquo;(which means Teacher). Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Do not hold me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brethren and&nbsp; say&nbsp; to them, I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.&rdquo; Mary Magdalene went and said to the disciples, &ldquo;I have seen the Lord&rdquo;; and she told them that he had said these things to her.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Sunday:</span> <em>God&rsquo;s Patience and Our Impatience.</em> We instinctively divide ourselves into good and evil, friends and enemies. The consequence of such a distinction is in tolerance and a desire to solve immediately whatever tensions arise from them. Some ask God to intervene and judge and punish others. The readings&lsquo; today tell us that God does not do things like that. The first reading, teaches us that he uses his power not to punish us, but to save us; he wants all of us to do likewise. The gospel tells us to accept with peace of mind the presence of evil in the world, and invites us to recognise the weeds in our own hearts. It assures us that the love of God will one day destroy it. The second reading speaks of the Spirit that prays for us, beseeching the Father to destroy all evil. This prayer will certainly be heard.</p>

You give repentance for sins.<br />

<p>There is no god besides you, whose care is for all men, to whom you should prove that you have not judged unjustly; for your strength is the source of righteousness, and your sovereignty over all causes you to spare all. For you show your strength when men doubt the completeness of your power, and rebuke any insolence among those who know it. You who are sovereign in strength judge with mildness, and with great forbearance you govern us; for you have power to act whenever you choose. Through such works you have taught your people that the righteous man must be kind, and you have filled your sons with good hope, because you give repentance for sins.</p>

Let both grow together until the harvest.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew (Matthew 13:24-43)</span></p>

<p>*At that time: Jesus put another parable before the crowds, saying, &ldquo;The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field; but while men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. So when the plants came up and bore grain, then the weeds appeared also. &ldquo;And the servants of the householder came and said to him, &lsquo;Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then has it weeds?&rsquo; He said to them, &lsquo;An enemy has done this.&rsquo; The servants said to him, &lsquo;Then do you want us to go and gather them?&rsquo; But he said, &lsquo;No; lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them. Let both grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn. &rdquo;&rsquo; * Another parable he put before them, saying, &ldquo;The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field; it is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.&rdquo; He told them another parable.&nbsp; &ldquo;The kingdom&nbsp; of heaven&nbsp; is like leaven which&nbsp; a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened.&rdquo; All this Jesus said to the crowds in parables; indeed&nbsp; he said nothing to them without a parable. This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet: &ldquo;I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter what has been hidden since the foundation of the world.&rdquo; &nbsp;Then he left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, &ldquo;Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;He who sows the good seed is the Son of man; the field is the world, and the good seed means the sons of the kingdom; the weeds are the sons of the evil one, and the enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the close of the &nbsp;age, and the reapers are angels. Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at the close&nbsp; of the&nbsp; age. The&nbsp; Son of man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers, and throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In those days: When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, the mind of Pharaoh and his servants was changed towards the people, and they said, &ldquo;What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?&rdquo; So he made ready his chariot and took his army with him, and took six hundred picked chariots and all the other chariots of Egypt with officers over all of them. And the Lord harened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt and he pursued the sons of Israel as they went forth defiantly. The Egyptians pursued them, all Pharaoh&rsquo;s horses and chariots and his horsemen and his army, and overtook them encamped at the sea, by Pihhiroth, in front of Baazephon. When Pharaoh drew near, the sons of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them; and they were in great fear. And the sons of Israel cried out to the Lord; and they said to Moses, &ldquo;Is it because there are no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? What have you done to us, in bringing us out of Egypt? Is not this what we said to you in Egypt, &lsquo;Let us alone and let us serve the Egyptians&rsquo;? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.&rdquo; And Moses said to the people, &ldquo;Fear not, stand firm, and see the salvation of the Lord, which he will work for you today; for the Egyptians whom you see today, you shall never, see again. The Lord will fight for you, and you have only to be still.&rdquo; The Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Why do you cry to me? Tell the sons of Israel to go forward. Lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, that the sons of Israel may go on dry ground through the sea. And I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they shall go in after them, and I will get glory over Pharaoh and all his host, his chariots, and his horsemen. And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I have gotten glory over Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.</p>

For as Jonah was three days&#39; and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">ST JAMES, AP.(FEAST)</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Today we celebrate the feast of James,<em> </em></span><em>the son of Zebedee and the brother of John the apostle and evangelist</em>. He was present, with Peter and John, at the special miracles worked by the Lord, at his transfiguration and in the garden of Gethsemane. He was the first of the apostles to be put to death (see Acts 12:1-3) around the year 42.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Entrance Antiphon cr.Mt4:18.21</span><br />
As he walked by the Sea of Galilee, Jesus saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother mending their nets and he called them.<br />
The Gloria in excelsis (Glory to God in the highest) is said.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Collect</span><br />

We carry always in the body the death of Jesus.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the second Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 4:7-15)</span></p>

<p>Brethren: We have this treasure in earthen vessels, to show that the transcendent power belongs to God and not to us. We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed; always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies. For while we live we are always being given up to death for Jesus&rsquo; sake, so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh. So death is at work in us, but life in you. Since we have the same spirit of faith as he had who wrote, &ldquo;I believed, and so I spoke,&rdquo; we too believe, and so we speak, knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence. For it is all for your sake, so that as grace extends to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving, to the glory of God.</p>

Are you able to drink the chalice that I am to drink?&rdquo; They said to him, &ldquo;We are able.&rdquo; He said to them, &ldquo;You will drink my chalice, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.&rdquo; And when the ten heard it, they were indignant at the two brothers. But Jesus called them to him and said, &ldquo;You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them. It shall not be so among you; but whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be your slave; even as the Son of man Name not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.</p>

I will rain bread from heaven for you.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Exodus (Exodus 16:1-5. 9-15)</span></p>

<p>The sons of Israel set out from Elim, and all the congregation of the sons of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had departed from the land of Egypt. And the whole congregation of the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness, and said to them, &ldquo;would that we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the fleshpots and ate bread to the full; for you have brought us out into this wildernesss to kill this whole assembly with hunger.&rdquo; Then the LORD said to Moses, &ldquo;Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a day&rsquo;s portion every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in my law or not. On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather daily.&rdquo; And Moses said to Aaron, &ldquo;Say to the whole congregation of the sons of Israel, &lsquo;Come near before the LORD, for he has heard your murmurings.&rdquo; And as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the sons of Israel, they looked towards the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud. And the LORD said to Moses, &ldquo;I have heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel; say to them, &lsquo;at twilight you shall eat flesh, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread; then you shall know that I am the LORD your God.&rdquo; In the evening quails came up and covered the camp; and in the morning dew lay around about the camp. And when the dew had gone up, there was on the face of the wilderness a fine, flake-like thing, fine as hoarfrost on the ground. When the sons of Israel saw it, they said to one another, &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo; for they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, &ldquo;it is the bread which the Lord has given you to eat.</p>

Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they had not much soil, and immediately they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil, but when the sun rose they were scorched; and since they had no root they withered away. Other seeds fell upon thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them. Other seeds fell on good soil and brought forth grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.

<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Exodus (Exodus 19: I-2.9-11.16-20b)</span></p>

<p>On the third new moon after the people of Israel had gone forth out of the land of Egypt, on that day they came into the wilderness of Sinai. And when they set out from Rephidim and came into the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mountain. And the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Behold, I am coming to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you for ever. Then Moses told the words of the people to the Lord. And the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments, and be ready by the third day; for on the third day the Lord will come down upon Moust Sinai in the sight of all the people.&rdquo; On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning, and a thick cloud upon the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast, so that all the people who were in the camp trembled. Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God; and they took their stand at the foot of the mountain. And Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke, because the. Lord descended upon it in fire; and the smoke of it went up like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain quaked greatly. And as the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him in thunder. And the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain; and the Lord called Moses to the top of the mountain.</p>

<p>At that time: The disciples came and said to Jesus, &ldquo;Why do you speak to them in parables?&rdquo; And he answered them, &ldquo;To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. For to him who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away. This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand. With them indeed is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says: &lsquo;You shall indeed hear but never understand, and you shall indeed see but never perceive. For this people&rsquo;s heart has grown dull, and their ears are heavy of hearing, and their eyes they have closed, lest they should perceive with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal them.&rsquo; &ldquo;But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear. Truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.</p>

You shall have no other gods before me.&nbsp; You shall not make for yourself a graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down to them or serve them; for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing mercy to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments. &ldquo;You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain. &ldquo;Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labour, and do all your work; but the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God; in it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your manservant, or your maidservant, or your cattle, or the sojourner who is within your gates; for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it. &ldquo;Honour your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land which the Lord your God gives you. &ldquo;You shall not kill.&rdquo; &ldquo;You shall not commit adultery.&rdquo; &ldquo;You shall not steal.&rdquo; &ldquo;You shall not bear false witness against your neighbour.&rdquo; &ldquo;You shall not covet your neighbour&rsquo;s house; you shall not covet your neighbour&rsquo;s wife, or his manservant, or his maidservant, or his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbour</p>

When any one hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the Evil One comes and snatches away what is sown in his heart; this is what was sown along the path. As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy; yet he has no foot in himself, but endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately he falls away. As for what was sown among thorns, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the delight in riches choke the word, and it proves unfruitful. As for what was sown on good soil, this is he who hears the word and understands it; he indeed bears fruit, and yields, in one case a hundred fold, in another sixty, and in another thirty.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Entrance Antiphon cf.Ps67:6-7.36</span><br />
God is in his holy place, God who unites those who dwell in his house; he himself gives might and strength to his people.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Collect</span><br />
O God, protector of those who hope in you, without whom nothing has firm foundation, nothing is holy, bestow in abundance your mercy upon us and grant that, with you as our ruler and guide, we may use the good things that pass in such a way as to hold fast even now to those that ever endure. Through our Lord...</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Sunday: </span><em>The Courage to Sell Off Everything. </em>The first reading and the gospel are joined by the theme of the search for treasure. For King Solomon the greatest treasure was the wisdom to enable him to govern his people well. For us the treasure is the kingdom of God. Who ever discovers it is determined to change their whole life to have it. The second reading tells us that God directs everything so that we may have the courage to make the right choice when challenging options are put before us.</p>

<p>FIRST READING<br />
You have asked for yourself understanding.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the first Book of Kings (1 Kings 3:5.7-12)</span></p>

<p>In those days: At Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, &ldquo;Ask what I shall give you.&rdquo; And Solomon said, &ldquo;O Lord my God, you have made your servant king in place of David my father, although I am but a little child; I do not know how to go out or come in. And your servant is in the midst of your people whom you have chosen, a great people that cannot be numbered or counted for multitude. Give your servant therefore a nunder standing mind to govern your people, that I may discern between good and evil; for who is able to govern this great people of yours?&rdquo; It pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this. And God said to him, &ldquo;Because you have asked this, and have not asked for yourself long life or riches or the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern what is right, behold, I now do according to your word. Behold, I give you a wise and discerning mind, so that none like you has been before you and none like you shall arise after you.</p>

<p>The word of the Lord.</p>

He predestined us to be conformed to the image of his Son.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Romans (Romans.8:28-30)</span></p>

<p>Brethren: We know that in everything God works for good with those who love him, who are called according to his purpose. For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the first&mdash;born among many brethren. And those whom he predestined he also called; and those whom he called he also justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified.</p>

He sells all that he has, and buys the field.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew (Matthew 13:44-52)</span></p>

<p>* Jesus said to the crowds, The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up; then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls, who, on finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it.*<br />
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net which was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind; when it was full, men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into vessels but threw away the bad. So it will be at the close of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous, and throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and quashing of teeth. &ldquo;Have you understood all this?&rdquo; They said to him, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; And he said to them, &ldquo;Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.</p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING</strong><br />
This people have sinned a great sin; they have made for themselves gods of gold.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Exodus (Exodus 32:15-24. 30-34)</span></p>

<p>In those days: Moses turned, and went down from the mountain with the two tables of the covenant in his hands, tables that were written on both sides; on the one side and on the other were they written. And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables. When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, &ldquo;there is a noise of war in the camp.&rdquo; But he said, &ldquo;it is not the sound of shouting for victory, or the sound of the cry of defeat, but the sound of singing that I hear.&rdquo; And as soon as he came near the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, Moses&rsquo; anger burnt hot and he threw the tables out of his hands and broke them at the foot of the mountain. And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire, and ground it to powder, and scattered it upon the water, and made the sons of Israel drink it. And Moses said to Aaron, &ldquo;what did this people do to you that you have brought a great sin upon them?&rdquo; and Aaron said, &ldquo;Let not the anger of my lord burn hot; you know the people, that they are set on evil. For they said to me, &lsquo;make us gods, who shall go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.&rsquo; And I said to them, &lsquo;let any who have gold take off; so they gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and there came out calf.&rdquo; The next day Moses said to the people, &ldquo;you have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up to the Lord; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.&rdquo; So Moses returned to the Lord and said, &ldquo;Alas, this people have sinned a great sin; they have made for themselves gods of gold. But now, if you will forgive their sin-and if not, blot me, I beg you, out of your book which you have written.&rdquo; But the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;whoever has sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book. But now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you; behold, my angel shall go before you. Nevertheless, in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them.</p>

A grain of mustard seed becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air make nests in its branches.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew (Matthew 13:31-35)</span></p>

<p>At that time: Another parable Jesus put before the crowds, saying, &ldquo;The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field; it is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.&rdquo; He told them another parable. &ldquo;The kingdom of heaven is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened.&rdquo; All this Jesus said to the crowds in parables; indeed he said nothing to them without a parable. This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet: I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter what has been hidden since the foundation of the world.</p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING</strong><br />
The Lord spoke to Moses face to face.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Exodus (Exodus 33:7-11:34:5b-9.28)</span></p>

<p>In those days: Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, far off from the camp; and he called it the tent of meeting. And every one who sought the Lord would go out to the tent of meeting, which was outside the camp. Whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people rose up, and every man stood at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he had gone into the tent. When Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the door of &nbsp;the tent, and the Lord would speak with Moses. And when all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the door of the tent, all the people would rise up and worship, every man at his tent door. Thus the Lord used to speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. When Moses turned again into the camp, his servant Joshua the son of &nbsp;Nun, a young man, did not depart from the tent. And Moses proclaimed the name of the Lord. The Lord passed before him, and proclaimed, &ldquo;The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow toanger, and abounding in mercy and faithfulness, keeping merciful love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and the children&rsquo;s children, to the third and the fourth generation.&rdquo; And Moses made haste to bow his head towards the earth, and worshipped. And he said, &ldquo;If now&nbsp; I have found favour in your sight, O Lord, let the Lord, I beg you, go in the midst of us, although it is a stiff-necked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.&rdquo; &nbsp;And he was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread nor drank water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">RESPONSORIAL PSALM Psalm 103:6-7.8-9.10-11.12-13 (R. 8a)</span><br />
<strong><span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span>The Lord is compassionate and gracious.</strong></p>

<p>The Lord does just deeds,<br />
Gives full justice to all who are oppressed.<br />
He made known his ways to Moses,<br />
And his deeds to the children of Israel. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p>The Lord is compassionate and gracious,<br />
slow to anger and rich in mercy.<br />
He will not always find fault;<br />

nor repay us according to our faults.<br />

so strong his mercy for those who fear him.<span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

Just as the weeds are gathered and burnt with fire, so it will be at the close of the age.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew (Matthew 13:36-43)</span></p>

<p>At that time: Jesus left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, &ldquo;Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;He who sows the good seed is the Son of man; the field is the world, and the good seed means the sons of the kingdom; the weeds are the sons of the evil one, and the enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the close of the age, and the reapers are angels. Just as the weeds are gathered and burnt with fire, so will it be at the close of the age. The Son of man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evil doers, and throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.</p>

Seeing the skin of Moses face, they were afraid to come near him.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Exodus (Exodus 34:29-35)</span></p>

<p>When Moses came down from Mount Sinai, with the two tables of the covenant in his hand as he came down from the mountain Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because he had been talking with God. And when Aaron and all the sons of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come near him. But Moses called to them; and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and Moses talked with them. And afterward all the sons of Israel came near, and he gave them in commandment all that the Lord had spoken with him in Mount Sinai. And when Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil on his face; but whenever Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out; and when he came out, and told the sons of Israel what he was commanded, the sons of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses face shone; and Moses would put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.</p>

<p>In those days: According to all that the Lord commanded him, so Moses did. And in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, the tabernacle was erected. Moses erected the tabernacle; he laid its bases, and set up its frames, and put in its poles, and raised up its pillars; and he spread the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent over it, as the Lord had commanded Moses. And he took the covenant and put it into the ark, and put the poles on the ark, and set the mercy seat above on the ark; and he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the Covenant; as the Lord had commanded Moses. Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. And Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting, because the cloud abode upon it, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. Throughout all their journeys, whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the sons of Israel would go onward; but if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not go onward till the day that it was taken up. For throughout all their journeys the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was in it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel.</p>

<p>The Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;These are the appointed feasts of the Lord, the holy convocations, which you shall proclaim at the time appointed for them. In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening, is the Lord&rsquo;s Passover. And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread to the Lord; seven days you shall eat unleavened bread. On the first day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work. But you shall present an offering by fire to the Lord seven days; on the seventh day is a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work. And the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;say to the sons of Israel, when you come into the land which I give you and reap its harvest, you shall bring the sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest; and he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord, that you may find acceptance; on the day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it. And you shall count from the day after the Sabbath, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven full weeks shall they be, counting fifty days to the day after the seventh Sabbath; then you shall present a cereal offering of new grain to the Lord. On the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement; it shall be for you a time of holy convocation, and you shall afflict yourselves and present an offering by fire to the Lord. On the fifteenth day of this seventh month and for seven days is the feast of booths to the Lord. On the first day shall be a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work. Seven days you shall present offerings by fire to the Lord; on the eight day you shall hold a holy convocation and present an offering by fire to the Lord, it is a solemn assembly; you shall do no laborious work. These are the appointed feasts of the Lord, which you shall proclaim as times of holy convocation, for presenting to the Lord offerings by fire, burnt offerings and cereal offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings, each on its proper day.</p>

But Jesus said to them, &ldquo;A prophet is not without honour except in his own country and in his own house.&rdquo; And he did not do many mighty works there, because of their unbelief.</p>

In this year of jubilee each of you shall return to his property.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Leviticus (Leviticus 25:l.8-17)</span></p>

<p>The Lord said to Moses on Mount Sinai, You shall count seven weeks of years, seven times seven years, so that the time of the seven weeks of years shall be to you forty-nine years. Then you shall send abroad the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the day of atonement you shall send abroad the trumpet throughout all your land. And you shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants; it shall be a jubilee for you, when each of you shall return to his property and each of you shall return to his family. A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be to you; in it you shall neither sow, nor reap what grows of itself, nor gather the grapes from the undressed vines. For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you; you shall eat what it yields out of the field. &ldquo;In this year of jubilee each of you shall return to his property. And if you sell to your neighbour or buy from your neighbour, you shall not wrong one another. According to the number of years after the jubilee, you shall buy from your neighbour, and according to the number of years of crops he shall sell to you. If the years are many you shall increase the price, and if the years are few you shall diminish the price, for it is the number of the crops that he is selling to you. You shall not wrong one another, but you shall fear your God; for I am the Lord your God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus; and he said to his servants, &ldquo;This is John the Baptist, &#39; he has been raised from the dead; that is why these powers are at work in him.&rdquo; &nbsp;For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison, for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip&rsquo;s wife; because John said to him, &ldquo;It is not lawful for you to have her.&rdquo; And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet. But when Herod&rsquo;s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company, and pleased Herod, so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask. Prompted by her mother, she said, &ldquo;Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.&rdquo; And the king was sorry; but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given; he sent and had John beheaded in the prison, and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother. And his disciples came and took the body and buried it; and they went and told Jesus.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">THE TRANSFIGURATION OF THE LORD (Feast)</span><br />
Today we remember the revelation of Christ as the beloved Son of the Father, the one we are called to listen to. This special moment on the mountain is meant to give the three chosen disciples, Peter, James and John, strength and courage and to prepare them for the agony in the garden when they will be chosen again to stay close to the Lord.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Feast:</span> <strong>Jesus Reveals His Face. Jesus speaks of himself as the &ldquo;son of man</strong>.&rdquo; He used a generic expression that simply means &ldquo;man.&rdquo; He used this expression to avoid misunderstandings that other titles, say, king or messiah, might have caused. He used the term also to refer to the vision in the book of Daniel in the first reading. The distance between the kingdom of this world and the kingdom of God can be compared to the distance between the instincts of wild beasts and the feelings of a heart of man. Jesus begins the new kingdom of God. The Gospel brings out the surprising way chosen by God to establish his kingdom. It was not going to be a kingdom founded on power&mdash; as the kingdoms before him&mdash;but a kingdom founded on self-giving and love. If we look at what is happening all around us, we can easily be discouraged and might even conclude that the Kingdom of God will never be established in this world. We see that even after two thousand years &ldquo;the beasts&rdquo; seem to be winning. This difficulty has been raised since the first century&mdash;as we read in the second reading. The reply&mdash;says Peter&mdash;is to be sought in the &ldquo;lamp shining in the dark place&rdquo;: the word of God entrusted to us.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Entrance Antiphon Cf. Mt 17:5</span><br />
In a resplendent cloud the Holy Spirit appeared. The Father&rsquo;s voice was heard: This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. Listen to him. &nbsp; The Gloria in excelsis (Glory to God in the highest) is said.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Collect</span><br />
O God, who in the glorious Transfiguration of your Only Begotten Son confirmed the mysteries of faith by the witness of the Fathers and wonderfully prefigured our full adoption to sonship, grant, we pray, to your servants, that, listening to the voice of your beloved Son, we may merit to become coheirs with him. Who lives and reigns with you. ..</p>

His clothing was as white as snow.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of the Prophet Daniel (Daniel 7:9-10.13-14)</span></p>

<p>As I looked, thrones were placed and one that was ancient of days took his seat; his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, its wheels were burning fire. A stream of fire issued and came forth from before him; a thousand thousands served him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; the court sat in judgement, and the books were opened. I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven there came one like a son of man, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him. And to him was given dominion and glory and kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed.</p>

<p>Beloved: We did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eye witnesses of his majesty. For when he received honour and glory from God the Father and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory, &ldquo;This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased,&rdquo; we heard this voice borne from heaven, for we were with him on the holy mountain. And we have the prophetic word made more sure. You will do well to pay attention to this as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.</p>

And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his garments became white as light. And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him. And Peter said to Jesus, &nbsp;&ldquo;Lord, it is well that we are here; if you wish, I will make three booths here, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.&rdquo; He was still speaking, when behold, a bright cloud over shadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, &ldquo;This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.&rdquo; When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces, and were filled with awe. But Jesus came and touched them, saying, &ldquo;Rise, and have no fear.&rdquo; And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only. And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, &ldquo;Tell no one the vision, until the Son of man is raised from the dead.</p>

I am not able to carry all this people alone.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the&nbsp; Book&nbsp; of Numbers (Numbers 11:4b-15)</span></p>

<p>In those days: The people of Israel said, &ldquo;O that we had meat to eat! We remember the fish we ate in Egypt for nothing, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic; but now our strength is dried up, and there is nothing at all but this manna to look at.&rdquo; Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like that of gum resin. The people went about and gathered it, and ground it in mills or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it; and the taste of it was like the taste of cakes baked with oil. When the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell with it. Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent; and the anger of the Lord blazed hotly, and Moses was displeased. Moses said to the Lord, &ldquo;Why have you dealt ill with your servant? And why have I not found favour in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people upon me? Did I conceive all this people? Did I bring them forth, that you should say to me, &lsquo;Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries the sucking child,&rsquo; to the land which you swore to give their fathers? Where am I to get meat to give to all this people? For they weep before me and say, &lsquo;Give us meat, that we may eat. &rsquo;I am not able to carry all this people alone, the burden is too heavy for me. If you will deal thus with me, kill me at once, if I find favour in your sight, that I may not see my wretchedness.</p>

<p>At that time: When Jesus heard [of the death of John the Baptist], he withdrew from there in a boat to a lonely place apart. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns. As he went ashore he saw a great throng; and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick. When it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, &ldquo;This is a lonely place, and the day is now over; send the crowds away to go into the villages and buy food for themselves.&rdquo; Jesus said. &ldquo;They need not go away; you give them something to eat.&rdquo; They said to him, &ldquo;We have only five loaves here and two fish.&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Bring them here to me.&rdquo; Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass; and taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces left over. And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</p>

But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified. saying, &ldquo;It is a ghost!&rdquo; And they cried out for fear. But immediately he spoke to them, saying, &ldquo;Take heart, it is I; have no fear.&rdquo; And Peter answered him, &ldquo;Lord, if it is you, bid me come to you on the water.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Come.&rdquo; So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus; but when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, &ldquo;Lord, save me.&rdquo; Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him, saying to him, &ldquo;O you of little faith, why did you doubt?&rdquo; And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased. And those in the boat worshipped him, saying, &ldquo;Truly you are the Son of God.&rdquo; And when they had crossed over they came to land at Gennesaret.

Has he not spoken through us also?&rdquo; And the Lord heard it. Now the man Moses was very meek, more than all men that were on the face of the earth. And suddenly the Lord said to Moses and to Aaron and Miriam, &ldquo;Come out, you three, to the tent of meeting.&rdquo; And the three of them came out. And the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forward. And he said, &ldquo;Hear my words: If there is a prophet among you, I the Lord make myself known to him in a vision, I speak with him in a dream. Not so with my servant Moses; he is entrusted with all my house. With him I speak mouth to mouth, clearly, and not in dark speech; and he beholds the form of the Lord. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?&rdquo; And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them, and he departed; and when the cloud removed from over the tent, behold, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow. And Aaron turned towards Miriam, and behold, she was leprous. And Aaron said to Moses, &ldquo;Oh, my lord, do not punish us because we have done foolishly and have sinned. Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother&rsquo;s womb.&rdquo; And Moses cried to the Lord, &ldquo;Heal her, O God, I beg you.</p>

And they came to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the sons of Israel in the wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh; they brought back word to them and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land. And they told him, &ldquo;We came to the land to which you sent us;&nbsp;&nbsp; it flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit. Yet the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large; and besides, we saw the descendants of Anak there. The Amalekites dwell in the land of the Negeb; the Hittites, the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the hill country; and the Canaanitesd well by the sea, and along the Jordan.&rdquo; But Caleb quieted the people before Moses, and said, &ldquo;Let us go up at once, and occupy it; for we are well able to over come it.&rdquo; Then the men who had gone up with him said, &ldquo;We are not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.&rdquo; So they brought to the sons of Israel an evil report of the land which they had spied out, saying, &ldquo;The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that devours its inhabitants; and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature. And there we saw the Nephilim (the sons of Anak, who come from the Nephilim); and we seemed to ourselves like grasshoppers, and so we seemed to them.&rdquo; Then all the congregation raised a loud cry; and the people wept that night. And the Lord said to Moses and to Aaron, &ldquo;How long shall this wicked congregation murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel, which they murmur against me. Say to them, &lsquo;As I live, says the Lord, what you have said in my hearing I will do to you: your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; of all your number, &nbsp;numbered from twenty years old and upward, who have murmured&nbsp; against&nbsp; me. According&nbsp; to the number&nbsp; of the&nbsp; days in which you spied out the land, forty days, for everyday a year, you shall bear your iniquity, forty years, and you shall know my displeasure.&rsquo; I, the Lord, have spoken; surely this will I do to all this wicked congregation that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall come to a full end, and there they shall die.</p>

And his disciples came and begged him, saying, &ldquo;Send her away, for she is crying after us.&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.&rdquo; But she came and knelt before him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, help me.&rdquo; And he answered, &ldquo;It is not fair to take the children&rsquo;s bread and throw it to the dogs.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters&rsquo; table.

SAINT LAWRENCE, Deacon and Martyr (Feast)</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Lawrence is probably the most famous of the Roman martyrs.</span> He was a deacon full of love for the poor, filled with courage before his torturers and a good sense of humour even while dying for his faith in 258. Tradition holds that as he was roasting to death on a gridiron, he asked his torturers to turn him over, since he was &ldquo;done&rdquo; enough on that side. Devotion to Lawrence was wide- spread by the fourth century.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Entrance Antiphon</span><br />
This is the blessed Lawrence, who gave himself up for the treasure of the Church: for this he earned the suffering of martyrdom to ascend with joy to the Lord Jesus Christ.<span style="font-size:11px"><span style="color:#ff0000">The Gloria in excels is (Glory to God in the highest) is said.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Collect</span><br />

God loves a cheerful giver.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the second Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 9:6b-10)</span></p>

<p>Brethren: He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. Each one must do as he has made up his mind, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to provide you with every blessing in abundance, so that you may always have enough of everything and may provide in abundance for every good work. As it is written, &ldquo;He scatters abroad, he gives to the poor; his righteousness endures for ever.&rdquo; He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your resources and increase the harvest of your righteousness.</p>

He loved your fathers and chose their descendants after them.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 4:32-40)</span></p>

<p>Moses spoke to the people, saying, Ask now of&nbsp; the&nbsp; days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from one end of heaven to the other, whether such a great thing as this has ever happened or was ever heard of. Did any people ever hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and still live? Or has God ever attempted to go and take a nation for himself from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, and by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes? To you it was shown, that you might know that the Lord is God; there is no other besides him. Out of heaven he let you hear his voice, that he might discipline you; and on earth&nbsp;&nbsp; he let you see his great fire, and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire. And because he loved your fathers and chose their descendants after them, and brought you out of Egypt with his own presence; by his great power, driving out before you nations greater and mightier than yourselves, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as at this day; know therefore this day, and lay it to your heart, that the Lord is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath; there is no other. Therefore&nbsp; you shall keep his statutes and his commandments, which I command you this day, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which the Lord your&nbsp; God gives you forever.</p>

<p>At that time: Jesus told his disciples,If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. For what will it profit a man, if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life? Or what shall a man give in return for his life? For the Son of man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay every man for what he has done. Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.</p>

How long am I to bear with you? Bring him here to me.&rdquo; And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him, and the boy was cured instantly. Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, &ldquo;Why could we not cast it out?&rdquo; He said to them, &ldquo;Because of your little faith.

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Sunday</span>: <strong>Revelation of God and the Revelation of Christ</strong>. The first reading and the gospel have the same theme, the revelation of the face of God. In the first reading God manifests himself to Elijah in a completely new way, different from the pagan gods and from the way to which Israel was accustomed. In the gospel we have a further revelation of God, through Jesus who comes, like the God of the Old Testament, as master of the sea, giving his own divine power to humans. The second reading touches on the same theme as it reminds us of the difficulties Paul had to face. We could say that he was saved by Jesus who stretched out his hand to him, just as he did to Peter.</p>

And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up into the hills by himself to pray. When evening came, he was&nbsp;&nbsp; there alone, but the boat by this time was many furlongs distant from the land, beaten by the waves; for the wind was against them. And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, saying, &ldquo;It is a ghost!&rdquo; And they cried out for fear. But immediately he spoke to them, saying, &ldquo;Take heart, it is I; have no fear.&rdquo; And Peter answered him, &ldquo;Lord, if it is you, bid me come to you on the water.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Come.&rdquo; So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus; but when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, &ldquo;Lord, save me.&rdquo; Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him, saying to him, &ldquo;O you of little faith, why did you doubt?&rdquo; And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased. And those in the boat worshipped him, saying, &ldquo;Truly you are the Son of God.&rdquo;</p>

Circumcise your heart. Love the sojourner, for you were sojourners.<br />

<p>Moses spoke to the people, saying, And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God require of you, but to fear the Lord your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, and to keep the commandments and statutes of the Lord, which I command you this day for your good? Behold, to the Lord your God belong heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth with all that is in it; yet the Lord set his heart in love upon your fathers and chose their descendants after them, you above all peoples, as at this day. Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no longer stubborn. For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who is not partial and takes no bribe. He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the sojourner, giving him food and clothing. Love the sojoumer therefore; for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt. You shall fear the Lord your God; you shall serve him and cling to him, and by his name you shall swear. He is your praise; he is your God, who has done for you these great and terrible things which your eyes have seen. Your fathers went down to Egypt seventy persons; and now the Lord your God has made you as the stars of heaven for multitude.</p>

<p>In those days: David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the Lord to its place, which he had prepared for it. And David gathered together the sons of Aaron and the Levites. And the Levites carried the ark of God upon their shoulders with the poles, as Moses had commanded according to the word of the Lord. David also commanded the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their brethren as the singers who should play loudly on musical instruments, on harps and lyres and cymbals, to raise sounds of joy. And they brought in the ark of God, and set it inside the tent which David had pitched for it; and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God. And when David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord.</p>

Today&rsquo;s Rosary: The Sorrowful Mystery</p>

<p><strong>THE ASSUMPTION OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY(Solemnity)</strong></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">At the Mass during the Day</span><br />
The solemnity of the Assumption celebrates the completion of God&rsquo;s triumph in Mary. The one who had been chosen in a special way to be the Mother of the Lord and of the Church, the one who had been filled with the Holy Spirit at the Annunciation and Pentecost, the one who is full of grace, now lives in the glory of heaven, in body and soul, sharing in the resurrection of Christ. Pope Pius XII declared the bodily assumption of Mary into heaven as a dogma of the Church in 1950.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Feast:</span> The Lord Did Great Things in Her Life. The world is a battle field where the forces of death and the forces of life battle each other. It is easy to see that the forces of death appear, in many cases, to have the upper hand: hatred, solitude, betrayals, social and economic injustice, fear, disease: these are all points scored in favour of the forces of death. There is however a particular moment when death manifests its overwhelming power: when it ends our days on earth. What does God, who created us for life, do? Doe she just look on unmoved at our defeat? Mary, who celebrates today the triumph of life over death, gives us the appropriate reply to these distressing questions.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Entrance Antiphon Cf. Rv12:1</span><br />
A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon beneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Or:</span></p>

<p>Let us all rejoice in the Lord, as we celebrate the feast day in honour of the Virgin Mary, at whose Assumption the Angels rejoice and praise the Son of God. <span style="color:#ff0000">The Gloria in excelsis (Glory to God in the highest) is said.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Collect</span><br />
Almighty ever-living God, who assumed the Immaculate Virgin Mary, the Mother of your Son, body and soul into heavenly glory, grant, we pray, that, always attentive to the things that are above, we may merit to be sharers of her glory. Through our Lord.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING</strong><br />
A woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Revelation (Revelation 11:19a:12:1-6a.10ab)</span></p>

<p>God&rsquo;s temple in heaven was opened. And a great sign appeared in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars; she was with child and she cried out in her pangs of birth, in anguish for delivery. And another sign appeared in heaven; behold, a great red dragon, with seven heads and ten horns, and seven diadems upon his heads. His tails wept down a third of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bear a child, that he might devour her child when she brought it forth; she brought forth a male child, one who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron, but her child was caught up to God and to his throne, and the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God. And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, &ldquo;Now the salvation and the power and kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The word of the Lord.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">RESPONSORIAL PSALM Psalm45:I0.11.12.16 (R.10b)</span><br />

<p>The daughters of kings are those whom you favour.<br />
On your tight stands the queen in gold of Ophir. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p>Listen, O daughter; pay heed and give ear;<br />

<p>So will the king desire your beauty.<br />

<p><strong>SECOND READING</strong><br />
Christ the first fruits, then those who belong to Christ.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the first Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians (I Corinthians 15:20-27)</span></p>

<p>Brethren: Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep. For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. For a sin Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive. But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ. Then comes the end, when he delivers the kingdom to God the Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power. For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. The last enemy to be destroyed is death. &ldquo;For God has put all things in subjection under his feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The word of the Lord.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">ALLELUIA</span><br />

He who is mighty has done great things for me, he has exalted those of low degree.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke (Luke 1:39-56)</span></p>

<p>In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a city of Judah, and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the child leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and she exclaimed with a loud cry, &ldquo;Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And why is this granted me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold, when the voice of your greeting came to my ears, the child in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.&rdquo; And Mary said, &ldquo;My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour, for he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden. For behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed; for he who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name. And his mercy is on those who fear him from generation to generation. He has shown strength with his arm, he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts, he has put down the mighty from their thrones, and exalted those of low degree; he has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent empty away. He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy, as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his posterity forever.&rdquo; And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her home.</p>

Moses died there, according to the word of the Lord, and there has not arisen a prophet like him.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 34:1-12</span></p>

<p>In those days: Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho. And the Lord showed him all the land, Gilead as far as Dan, all Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh,&nbsp; all the&nbsp; land of Judah&nbsp; as far as the western sea, the Negeb, and the Plain, that is, the valley of Jericho the city of palm trees, as far as Zoar. And the Lord said to him, &ldquo;This is the land of which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, &lsquo;I will give it to your descendants.&rsquo; I have let you see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over there.&rdquo; So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord, and he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab opposite Beth-peor; but no man knows the place of his burial to this day. Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when hedied; his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. And the sons of &nbsp;Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days; then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended. And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had &nbsp;laid his hands upon him; so the people of Israel obeyed &nbsp;him, and did as the Lord had commanded Moses. And there has not arisen a prophet since in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face, none like him for all the signs and the wonders which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land, and for all the mighty power and all the great and terrible deeds which Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel.</p>

If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.<br />

<p>At that time: Jesus said to his disciples, &ldquo;If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of &nbsp;two or three witnesses. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the Church; and if he refuses to listen even to the Church, let him be to you as a Gentile&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a tax collector. Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound &nbsp;in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Again I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</p>

The ark of the covenant of the Lord is to pass over before you into the Jordan.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Joshua (Joshua 3 :7-10a.11.13-17)</span></p>

<p>In those days: The Lord said to Joshua, &ldquo;This day I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, &nbsp;that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. And you shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, &lsquo;When you come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan. &rdquo;&rsquo; And Joshua said to the sons of Israel, &ldquo;Come here, and hear the words of the Lord your God.&rdquo; And Joshua said, &ldquo;Here by you shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites. Behold, the ark of &nbsp;the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is to pass over before you into the Jordan. And when the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan shall be stopped from flowing, and the waters coming down from above shall stand &nbsp;in one heap.&rdquo; So, when the people set out from their tents, to passover the Jordan with the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people, and when those who bore the ark had come to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests bearing the ark were dipped in the brink of the water (the Jordan over flows all its banks throughout the time of harvest), the waters coming down from above stood and rose up in a heap far off, at Adam, the city that&nbsp; is beside Zarethan, and those flowing down towards the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off; and the people passed over opposite Jericho. And while all Israel were passing over on &nbsp;dry ground, the priests who bore the ark of &nbsp;the covenant of the Lord stood on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, until all the nation finished passing over the Jordan.</p>

I do not say to you to forgive seven times, but seventy times seven.<br />

<p>At that time: Peter came up and said to Jesus, &ldquo;Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?&rdquo; Jesus said to him, &ldquo;I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven. &ldquo;Therefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants. When he began the reckoning, one was brought to him who owed him ten &nbsp;thousand &nbsp;talents; and as he could not pay, his lord ordered him to be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made. So the servant fell on his knees, imploring him, &lsquo;Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay you everything. &rsquo; &ldquo;And out of pity for him the lord of that servant released him and forgave him the debt. But that same servant, as he went out, came upon one of his fellow servants who owed him ahundred denarii; and seizing him by the throat he said, &lsquo;Pay what you owe.&rsquo; &ldquo;So his fellow servant fell down and pleaded with him, &lsquo;Have patience with me, and I will pay you. &rsquo;He refused and went and put him in prison till he should pay the debt. When his fellow servants saw what had taken place, they were greatly distressed, and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place. Then his lord summoned him and said to him, &lsquo;You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me; and should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?&rsquo; And in anger his lord delivered him to the jailers, till he should pay all his debt. So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.&rdquo; Now when Jesus had finished these sayings, he went away from Galilee and entered the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.</p>

<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Joshua (Joshua 24:1-13)</span></p>

<p>In those days: Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and summoned the elders, the heads, the judges, and the officers of Israel; and they presented themselves before God. And Joshua said to all the people, &ldquo;Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, &lsquo;Your fathers lived of old beyond the Euphrates, Terah, the father of Abraham and of Nahor; and they served other gods. Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the River and led him through all the land of Canaan, and made his offspring many. I gave him Isaac; and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. And I gave Esau the hill country of Seir to possess, but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt. And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt with what I did in the midst of it; and afterwards I brought you out. Then I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea; and the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea. And when they cried to the Lord, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and made the sea come upon them and cover them; and your eyes saw what I did to Egypt; and you lived in the wilderness a long time. Then I brought you to the land of the Amorites, who lived on the other side of the Jordan; they fought with you, and I gave them into your hand, and you took possession of their land, and I destroyed them before you. Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel; and he sent and invited Balaam &nbsp;the son of &nbsp;Beor to curse you, but I would not listen to Balaam; therefore he blessed you; so I delivered you out of his hand. And you went over the Jordan and came to Jericho, and the men of Jericho fought against you, and also the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I gave them into your hand. And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out before you, the two kings of the Amorites; it was not by your sword or by your bow. I gave you a land on which you had not laboured, and cities which you had not built, and you dwell there in; you eat the fruit of vineyards and olive yards which you did not plant.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

So they are no longer two but one. What therefore God has joined together, &nbsp;let no man put asunder.&rdquo; They said to him, &ldquo;Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce, and to put her away?&rdquo; He said to them, &ldquo;For your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for unchastity, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries a divorced woman, commits adultery.&rdquo; The disciples said to him, &ldquo;If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.&rdquo; But he said to them, &ldquo;Not all men can receive this precept, but only those to whom it is given. For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to receive this, let him receive it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In those days: Joshua spoke to the people, saying, &ldquo;Now therefore fear the Lord, and serve him in sincerity and in faithfulness; put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, and&nbsp; in Egypt, and serve the Lord. And if you be unwilling to serve the Lord, choose this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your fathers served in the region beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell; but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. &rdquo;Then the people answered, &ldquo;Far be it from us that we should forsake the Lord, to serve other gods; for it is the Lord our God who brought us and our fathers up from the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, and who did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way that we went, and among all the peoples through whom we passed; and the Lord drove out before us all the peoples, the Amorites who lived in the land; therefore we also will serve the Lord, for he is our God.&rdquo; But Joshua said to the people, &ldquo;You cannot serve the Lord; for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions or your sins. If you forsake the Lord and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do you harm, and consume you, after having done you good.&rdquo; And the people said to Joshua, &ldquo;No; but we will serve the Lord.&rdquo; &nbsp;Then Joshua said to the people, &ldquo;You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the Lord, to serve him.&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;We are witnesses.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Then put away the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your heart to the Lord, the God of Israel.&rdquo; And the people said to Joshua, &lsquo;The Lord our God we will serve, and his voice we will obey.&rdquo; So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and made statutes and ordinances for them at Shechem. And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak in the sanctuary of the Lord. And Joshua said to all the people, &ldquo;Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us; for it has heard all the words of the Lord which he spoke to us; therefore it shall be a witness against you, lest you deal falsely with your God.&rdquo; So Joshua sent the people away, every man to his inheritance. After these things Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, being a hundred and ten years old.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Sunday:</span> <em><strong>What Does &ldquo;Catholic Church&rdquo; mean? &ldquo;Catholic&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;universal,&rdquo;</strong></em> that is, open to all people. The first reading tells us that Israel, before going into exile and before coming in contact with other peoples, was not &ldquo;catholic,&rdquo; it was closed in upon itself. Later Israel, more enlightened, realized that the one God is Father of all. The gospel shows what Jesus thinks.<br />
Christian communities must be really &ldquo;catholic,&rdquo; open to receive everybody, the second reading is related to this topic and shows that salvation is not a result of privilege or because one is a member of a certain people, but because one accepts the saving initiative of God.</p>

The gifts and the call of God are irrevocable.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Romans (Romans 11:13-15.29-32)</span></p>

<p>Brethren: I am speaking to you Gentiles. In as much then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry in order to make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of them. For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead? For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable. Just as you were once disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience, so they have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may receive mercy. For God has consigned all men to disobedience, that he may have mercy upon all.</p>

The Lord raised up judges, yet they did not listen to them.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Judges (Judges 2:11-19)</span></p>

<p>In those days: The sons of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and served the Baals; and they forsook the Lord, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt; they went after other gods, from among the gods of the peoples who were round about them, and bowed down to them; and they provoked the Lord to anger. They forsook the Lord, and served the Baals and the Ashtaroth. So the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he gave them over to plunderers, who plundered them; and he sold them into the power of their enemies round about, so that they could no longer withstand their enemies. Whenever they marched out, the hand of the Lord was against them for evil, as the Lord had warned, and as the Lord had sworn to them; and they were in great distress. Then the Lord raised up judges, who saved them out of the power of those who plundered them. And yet they did not listen to their judges; for they played the harlot after other gods and bowed down to them; they soon turned aside from the way in which their fathers had walked, who had obeyed the commandments of the Lord, and they did not do so. Whenever the Lord raised up judges for them, the Lord was with the judge, and he saved them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for the Lord was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who afflicted and oppressed them. But whenever the judge died, they turned back and behaved worse than their fathers, going after other gods, serving them and bowing down to them; they did not drop any of their practices or their stubborn ways.</p>

Jesus said to him, &ldquo;If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful; for he had great possessions.</p>

Gideon, go and deliver Israel. Do not I send you?<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Judges (Judges 6:11-24a)</span></p>

<p>In those days: The angel of the Lord came and sat under the oak at Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, as his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the wine press, to hide it from the Midianites. And the angel of the Lord appeared to him and said to him, &ldquo;The Lord is with you, you mighty man of valour.&rdquo; And Gideon said to him, &ldquo;Please, sir, if the Lord is with us, why then has all this be fallen us? And where are all his wonderful deeds which our fathers recounted to us, saying, &lsquo;Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt?&rsquo; But now the Lord has cast us off, and given us into the hand of Midian.&rdquo; And the Lord turned to him and said, &ldquo;Go in this might of yours and deliver Israel from the hand of Midian; do not I send you?&rdquo; And he said to him, &ldquo;Please, Lord, how can I deliver Israel? Behold, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family.&rdquo; And the Lord said to him, &ldquo;But I will be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one man.&rdquo; And he said to him, &ldquo;If now I have found favour with you, then show me a sign that it is you who speak with me: Do not depart from here, I beg you, until I come to you, and bring out my present, and set it before you.&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;I will stay till you return.&rdquo; So Gideon went into his house and prepared a kid, and unleavened cakes from an ephah of flour; the meat he put in a basket, and the broth he put in a pot, and brought them to him under the oak and presented them. And the angel of God said to him, &ldquo;Take them eat and the unleavened cakes, and put them on this rock, and pour the broth over them.&rdquo; And he did so. Then the angel of the Lord reached out the tip of the staff that was in his hand, and touched them eat and the unleavened cakes; and there sprang up fire from the rock and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and the angel of the Lord vanished from his sight. Then Gideon perceived that he was the angel of the Lord; and Gideon said, &ldquo;Alas, O Lord GOD! For now I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face.&rdquo; But the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Peace be to you; do not fear, you shall not die.&rdquo; Then Gideon built an altar there to the Lord, and called it, The Lord is peace.</p>

Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.&rdquo; When the disciples heard this they were greatly astonished, saying, &ldquo;Who then can be saved?&rdquo; But Jesus looked at them and said to them, &ldquo;With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.&rdquo; Then Peter said in reply, &ldquo;Behold, we have left everything and followed you. What then shall we have?&rdquo; Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Truly, I say to you, in the new world, when the Son of man shall sit on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And every one who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my name&rsquo;s sake, will receive a hundredfold, and inherit eternal life.

After agreeing with the labourers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard. And going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the market place; and to them he said, &lsquo;You go into the vineyard too, and whatever is right I will give you. &rsquo; So they went. Going out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, he did the same. And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing; and he said to them, &lsquo;Why do you stand here idle&nbsp; all&nbsp; day?&rsquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They said to him, &lsquo;Because no one has hired us. &rsquo; &ldquo;He said to them, &lsquo;You go into the vineyard too. &rsquo; &ldquo;And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, &lsquo;Call the labourers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, up to the first.&rsquo; And when those hired about the eleventh hour came, each of them received a denarius. Now when the first came, they thought they would receive more; but each of them also received a denarius. And on receiving it they grumbled at the householder, saying, &lsquo;These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.&rsquo; &ldquo;But he replied to one of them, &lsquo;Friend, I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for a denarius? Take what belongs to you, and go; I choose to give to this last as I give to you. Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or do you begrudge my generosity?&rsquo; So the last will be first, and the first last.</p>

Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess with her, and they came to Bethlehem.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">The beginning of the Book of Ruth (Ruth 1:1.3-6.14b-I6.22</span></p>

<p>In the days when the judges ruled there was a famine in the land, and a certain man of Bethlehem in Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he and his wife Naomi and his two sons. But Elimelech, the husband of Naomi, died, and she was left with her two sons. These took Moabite wives; the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth. They lived there about ten years; and both sons died, so that the woman was bereft of her two sons and her husband. Then she started with her daughters-in- law to return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab that the Lord had visited his people and given them food. And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law and went back, but Ruth clung to her. And she said, &ldquo;See, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in- law.&rdquo; But Ruth said, &ldquo;Entreat me not to leave you or to return from following you; for where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God.&rdquo; So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter- in-law with her, who returned from the country of Moab. And they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest.</p>

This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>FIRST READING<br />
The Lord has not left you this day without next of kin. This is the father of Jesse, the father of David.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the Book of Ruth (Ruth 2:1-3.8-11; 4:13-17)</span></p>

<p>Now Naomi had a kinsman of her husband&rsquo;s, a man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, whose name was Boaz. And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, &ldquo;Let me go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favour.&rdquo; And she said to her, &ldquo;Go, my daughter.&rdquo; So she set forth and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech. Then Boaz said to Ruth, &ldquo;Now, listen, my daughter, do not go to glean in another field or leave this one, but keep close to my maidens. Let your eyes be upon the field which they are reaping, and go after them. Have I not charged the young men not to molest you? And when you are thirsty, go to the vessels and drink what the young men have drawn.&rdquo; Then she fell on her face, bowing to the ground, and said to him, &ldquo;Why have I found favour in your eyes, that you should take notice of me, when I am a foreigner?&rdquo; But Boaz answered her, &ldquo;All that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband has been fully told me, and how you left your father and mother and your native land and came to a people that you did not know before. So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife; and he went in to her, and the Lord gave her conception, and she bore a son. Then the women said to Naomi, &ldquo;Blessed be the Lord, who has not left you this day without next of kin; and may his name be renowned in Israel! He shall be to you a restorer of life and a nourishesof your old age; for your daughter-in-law who loves you, who is more to you than seven sons, has borne him.&rdquo; Then Naomi took the child and laid him in her bosom, and became his nurse. And the women of the neighbourhood gave him a name, saying, &ldquo;A son has been born to Naomi.&rdquo; They named him Obed; he was the father of Jesse, the father of David.</p>

<p>At that time: Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, &ldquo;The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses&rsquo; seat; so practice and observe whatever they tell you, but not what they do; for they preach, but do not practice. They bind heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on men&rsquo;s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with their finger. They do all their deeds to be seen by men; for they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long, and they love the place of honour at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues, and salutations in the market places, and being called rabbi by men. But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brethren. And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven. Neither be called masters, for you have one master, the Christ. He who is greatest among you shall be your servant; whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">Theme of the Sunday:</span> <strong>Faith in Christ, the Rock On Which the Church is Founded. </strong>We find the theme of this Sunday in the gospel: faith in Christ, Son of the living God, is the foundation of the Church. The first reading is but a comment and explains the symbolism of the keys and clarifies how authority should be understood. The second reading can be seen in the light of this theme because it presents the mysterious ways God intervenes in the history of humanity, the way he uses to lead us to discover the identity of Jesus of Nazareth.</p>

In that day I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and I will clothe him with your robe, and will bind your belt on him, and will commit your authority to his hand; and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. And I will place on his shoulder the key of the house of David; he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.

For our appeal does not spring from error or uncleanness, nor is it made with guile; but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not to please men, but to please God who tests our hearts. For we never used either words of flattery, as you know, or a cloak for greed, as God is&nbsp;&nbsp; witness; nor did we seek glory from men, whether from you or from others, though we might have made demands as apostles of Christ. But we were gentle among you, like a nurse taking care of her children.

So you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous, saying, &lsquo;If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.&rsquo; Thus you witness against yourselves, that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets. Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers.</p>

<p><strong>FIRST READING</strong><br />
May the Lord make you increase and abound in love to one another and to all men.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the first Letter of Saint Paul to the Thessalonians (1 Thessalonians 3:7-13)</span></p>

<p>Brethren, in all our distress and affliction we have been comforted about you through your faith; for now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord. For what thanksgiving can we render to God for you, for all the joy which we feel for your sake before our God, praying earnestly night and day that we may see you face to face and supply what is lacking in your faith? Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you; and may the Lord make you increase and abound in love to one another and to all men, as we do to you, so that he may establish your hearts unblamable in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.</p>

<p>The word of the Lord.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000">RESPONSORIAL PSALM Psalm 90:3-4.12-13.14 and 17 (R. 14)</span><br />
<strong><span style="color:#ff0000">R. </span>Fill us with your merciful love, O Lord,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; And we shall exult.</strong></p>

<p>You turn man back to dust,<br />
And say, Return, O children of men.<br />
To your eyes a thousand years<br />
are like yesterday, come and gone,<br />
or like a watch in the night. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p>Then teach us to number our days,<br />
That we may gain wisdom of heart.<br />
Turn back, O Lord! How long?<br />
Show pity to your servants. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p>At dawn, fill us with your merciful love;<br />
we shall exult and rejoice all our days.<br />
Let the favour of the Lord our God be upon us;<br />
give success to the work of our hands.<br />
O give success to the work of our hands. <span style="color:#ff0000">R.</span></p>

<p>ALLELUIA Matthew 24:42a.44</p>

<p>Alleluia. Watch, therefore, and be ready; the Son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect. Alleluia.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>GOSPEL</strong><br />
Be ready.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew (Matthew 24:42-51)</span></p>

<p>At that time: Jesus said to his disciples, &ldquo;Watch, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. But know this, that if the householder had known in what part of the night the thief &nbsp;was coming, he would have watched and would not have let his house be broken &nbsp;into. Therefore you also must be ready; for the Son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect. &ldquo;Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his master has set over his household, to give them their food at the proper time? Blessed is that servant whom his master when he comes will find so doing. Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions. But if that wicked servant says to himself, &lsquo;My master is delayed,&rsquo; and begins to beat his fellow servants, and eats and drinks with the drunken; the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know, and will punish him, and put him with the hypocrites; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.&rdquo;</p>
