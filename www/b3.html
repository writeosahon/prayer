<p>O most pure heart of Mary, full of goodness, show your love towards us. Let the flame of your heart, O Mary, descend on all people. We love you immensely. Impress on our hearts true love so that we may long for you. O Mary, gentle and humble of heart, remember us when we sin. You know that we all sin. Grant that through your most pure and motherly heart, we may be healed from every spiritual sickness. Grant that we may always experience the goodness of your motherly heart, and that through the flame of your heart we may be converted. Amen.<br />

Virgin of Fatima, Mother of mercy, Queen of heaven and earth, Refuge of sinners, and Mother of the Church, today in full freedom, we consecrate our family to your sorrowful and Immaculate Heart. May your Heart be for the head of this family and its other members, a refuge and a dwelling.</p>

<p>From today, reign over us. Make our faith ever more enlightened, strong and fervent. Increase our hope so that in the midst of all earthly vicissitudes, our gaze may never turn away from the things of heaven. May our love of God and the neighbour grow so that it becomes a furnace in which are burnt away all our sins, imperfections, faults and defects. That these desires of ours be a reality, today we renew the promises of our baptism and confirmation. We will live according to the teaching of the Gospel of Jesus, we will show respect for our Holy Father the Pope, our Bishop and the other ecclesiastical authorities, we will love them, pray for them and follow their teaching.</p>

<p>Moreover, we will try our best: to pray daily the Rosary, participate in the Holy Mass and other Eucharistic devotions, to pray and work for the conversion of sinners and non-Christians, and for the return of those who are outside the Church of Christ or have left it.</p>

<p>Most Holy Virgin, our Mother and Queen, from today may this house be your own, may those who live in it and others who will come after us, be your own, so that after our death all of us may join together in heaven. May this consecration through your intercession hasten the coming of the Kingdom of Your Son Jesus; may He reign over us, our parish, our Archdiocese and the whole world. Amen.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="background-color:#0000ff">The Rite for the Consecration of a Parish to the Immaculate Heart of Mary</span></span></strong><br />
O Immaculate Heart of Mary, Mother of the Heart of Jesus, our Queen and our Mother! Look down with mercy upon this parish. We wish to show thee our filial love and to render to thee our homage by this solemn act.</p>

<p>We come to offer thee our whole being, body and soul, faculties and senses, our life with all its sorrows and joys, all that we possess, all that we are, all that we love.</p>

<p>O Immaculate Virgin, Mother of God and Mother of all men! We consecrate ourselves and our parish to thy Immaculate Heart. Receive us as thy children.</p>

<p>May thy Heart be for all of us priests and religious, catechists, parents and children, young people, adult and elderly, healthy and sick, absent, present and fallen away the path that leads to God.</p>

<p>Reign over us, O Beloved Mother, so that we may be thine both in prosperity and in adversity, in joy and in sorrow, in health and in sickness, in life and in death.</p>

<p>O most compassionate Heart of Mary, Queen of Virgins, watch over our minds and our hearts and preserve them from the flood of pride, impurity and paganism of which thou didst complain so bitterly at Fatima.</p>

<p>From this moment, thou art named Queen and Mother of this parish. Look after our spiritual and temporal well-being, hear our prayers and console us in the sorrows and tribulations of this life and particularly at the hour of our death.</p>

<p>We want to call down upon our families and parish, our country and the whole world the peace of God in justice and charity.</p>

<p>On our part, we promise to imitate thy virtues in a spirit of reparation and penance, by a true Christian life, by frequent confessions and holy Communions, by fervent participation in the divine Liturgy, by attentive study of the catechism without regard to human respect.</p>

<p>O Queen of the Holy Rosary, we promise to offer thee the prayer of the rosary each day.</p>

<p>We accept now, all the sacrifices that a Christian life will impose on us, and we offer them to the Heart of Jesus, by thy Immaculate Heart, in union with the Mass of thy divine Son.</p>

<p>O Mother of fair love, inflame in our hearts, parish and homes, with the divine fire to keep us faithful to our duty of state and to become, with the grace of God, zealous apostles towards our neighbours and poor sinners by our example, our sacrifices and prayers, bringing them to the practice of the true Faith.</p>

<p>May the reign of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, together with thy reign, enter this parish, our Queen and our Mother, so that living truly consecrated to thy love and service, we may one day deserve eternal happiness in the presence of the Holy Trinity. Amen.</p>
